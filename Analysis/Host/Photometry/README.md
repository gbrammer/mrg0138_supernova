Host photometry
==============

Derived from HST + IRAC images using a notebook similar to 
https://github.com/gbrammer/golfir/blob/master/notebooks/IRAC-fit-patches.ipynb.

The tables provide *observed frame* photometry and best-fit template derived
with [eazy-py](https://github.com/gbrammer/eazy-py) in f-lambda units of 
`erg/s/cm2/A`.
