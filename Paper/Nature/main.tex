\noindent Please note: Abbreviations should be introduced at the first mention in the main text â€“ no abbreviations lists. Suggested structure of main text (not enforced) is provided below.

\section*{Introduction}

The Introduction section, of referenced text\cite{Figueredo:2009dg} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

\section*{Results}

Up to three levels of \textbf{subheading} are permitted. Subheadings should not be numbered.

\subsection*{Subsection}

Example text under a subsection. Bulleted lists may be used where appropriate, e.g.

\begin{itemize}
\item First item
\item Second item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Third-level section}
 
Topical subheadings are allowed.

\section*{Discussion}

The Discussion should be succinct and must not contain subheadings.

\section*{Methods}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work.

\bibliography{sample}

\noindent LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, e.g.  \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}.

For data citations of datasets uploaded to e.g. \emph{figshare}, please use the \verb|howpublished| option in the bib entry to specify the platform and the link, as in the \verb|Hao:gidmaps:2014| example in the sample bibliography file.

\section*{Acknowledgements (not compulsory)}

Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and editors, or effusive comments. Grant or contribution numbers may be acknowledged.

\section*{Author contributions statement}

Must include all authors, identified by initials, for example:
A.A. conceived the experiment(s),  A.A. and B.A. conducted the experiment(s), C.A. and D.A. analysed the results.  All authors reviewed the manuscript. 

\section*{Additional information}

To include, in this order: \textbf{Accession codes} (where applicable); \textbf{Competing interests} (mandatory statement). 

The corresponding author is responsible for submitting a \href{http://www.nature.com/srep/policies/index.html#competing}{competing interests statement} on behalf of all authors of the paper. This statement must be included in the submitted article file.

    \caption{Overview of the field around the center of the MACSJ0138 cluster field and the locations of the lensed host (H1--4) and \SNABC (SN1--3) images. The wide-field view in $a)$ is 40\arcsec\ on a side with ticks indicating 10\arcsec\ intervals.  Panels b--g) show 4\arcsec\ cutouts around the lensed SN images with 1\arcsec\ ticks.  The three-color images are generated from the WFC3/IR filters as indicated; panels $b$--$d$ show the imaging from July 2016 where the SN was visible and $e$--$g$ show the later imaging from July 2019 where the the SN has faded away.  All panels use the late-epoch F125W imaging for the green channel.  Nevertheless, it is immediately clear that the SN2 image is substantially bluer than the other two, which we use in \S\ref{s:colorcurves} below to constrain the transient classification as a likely Ia supernova explosion.}
