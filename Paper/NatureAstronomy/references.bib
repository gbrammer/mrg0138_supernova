	abstract = {Objects of known brightness, like type Ia supernovae (SNIa), can be used to measure distances. If a massive object warps spacetime to form multiple images of a background SNIa, a direct test of cosmic expansion is also possible. However, these lensing events must first be distinguished from other rare phenomena. Recently, a supernova was found to shine much brighter than normal for its distance, which resulted in a debate: Was it a new type of superluminous supernova or a normal SNIa magnified by a hidden gravitational lens? Here, we report that a spectrum obtained after the supernova faded away shows the presence of a foreground galaxy—the first found to strongly magnify a SNIa. We discuss how more lensed SNIa can be found than previously predicted.},

1044 erg s-1. We show that the spectra of
this transient source are well fit by normal Type Ia supernova (SNIa) templates. The multi-band colors and light-curve shapes are also consistent with normal SNeIa at the spectroscopically determined redshift of z = 1.3883; however, the observed flux is a constant factor of {\textasciitilde}30 times too bright in each band over time as compared to the templates. At minimum, this shows that the peak luminosities inferred from the light-curve widths of some SNeIa will deviate significantly from the established, empirical relation used by cosmologists. We argue on physical grounds that the observed fluxes do not reflect an
intrinsically luminous SNIa, but rather PS1-10afx is a normal SNIa whose flux has been magnified by an external source. The only known
astrophysical source capable of such magnification is a gravitational lens. Given the lack of obvious lens candidates, such as galaxy
clusters, in the vicinity, we further argue that the lens is a
supermassive black hole or a comparatively low-mass dark matter halo. In this case, the lens continues to magnify the underlying host galaxy light. If confirmed, this discovery could impact a broad range of topics including cosmology, gamma-ray bursts, and dark matter halos.},

	abstract = {Strong lensing time-delay systems constrain cosmological parameters via the so-called time-delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the lens. In previous studies, only the former information was used in forecasting cosmographic constraints. In this paper, we show that the cosmological constraints improve significantly when the latter information is also included. Specifically, the angular diameter distance plays a crucial role in breaking the degeneracy between the curvature of the Universe and the time-varying equation of state of dark energy. Using a mock sample of 55 bright quadruple lens systems based on expectations for ongoing/future imaging surveys, we find that adding the angular diameter distance information to the time-delay distance information and the Planck's measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies improves the constraint on the constant equation of state by 30\%, on the time variation in the equation of state by a factor of two, and on the Hubble constant in the flat ΛCDM model by a factor of two. Therefore, previous forecasts for the statistical power of time-delay systems were overly pessimistic, i.e., time-delay systems are more powerful than previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (\$H\_\{0\}\$) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}\$, a 2.4\% precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of \$H\_\{0\}\$ from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in \$3.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in \$5.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ CMB determinations of \$H\_\{0\}\$ in flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from \$Planck\$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our \$H\_\{0\}\$ inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on \$H\_0\$ ranges from 73-78 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

In particular we ﬁnd, with a high statistical signiﬁcance, that the type Ia rate in late type galaxies is a factor ∼20 higher than in E/S0. Similarly, the type Ia rate in the galaxies bluer than B − K = 2.6 is about a factor of 30 larger than in galaxies with B − K {\textgreater} 4.1. These ﬁndings can be explained by assuming that a signiﬁcant fraction of Ia events in late spirals/irregulars originates in a relatively young stellar component.},

We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magniﬁcation bias and image conﬁguration detectability into account. We ﬁnd that upcoming wide-ﬁeld synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should ﬁnd more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The LSST should also ﬁnd some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with ∼15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be ∼15 per cent for the lensed quasars and ∼30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed doubleimage lenses, as could be derived from the LSST survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent conﬁdence intervals are σ (w0) = 0.15, σ (wa) = 0.41 and σ (h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy ﬁgure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.},

The minimum initial mass that can produce a supernova (SN) has converged to 8 ± 1 M⊙ from direct detections of red supergiant progenitors of II-P SNe and the most massive white dwarf progenitors, although this value is model dependent. It appears that most type Ibc SNe arise from moderate mass interacting binaries. The highly energetic, broad-lined Ic SNe are likely produced by massive, Wolf-Rayet progenitors. There is some evidence to suggest that the majority of massive stars above ∼20 M⊙ may collapse quietly to black holes and that the explosions remain undetected. The recent discovery of a class of ultrabright type II SNe and the direct detection of some progenitor stars bearing luminous blue variable characteristics suggest some very massive stars do produce highly energetic explosions. The physical mechanism is under debate, and these SNe pose a challenge to stellar evolutionary theory.},

The simulation was realized in the griz filters of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with realistic observing conditions (sky noise, point-spread function, and atmospheric transparency) based on years of recorded conditions at the DES site. Simulations of non–Ia-type SNe are based on spectroscopically confirmed light curves that include unpublished non-Ia samples donated from the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP), the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II). A spectroscopically confirmed subset was provided for training. We challenged scientists to run their classification algorithms and report a type and photo-z for each SN. Participants from 10 groups contributed 13 entries for the sample that included a host-galaxy photo-z for each SN and nine entries for the sample that had no redshift information. Several different classification strategies resulted in similar performance, and for all entries the performance was significantly better for the training subset than for the unconfirmed sample. For the spectroscopically unconfirmed subset, the entry with the highest average figure of merit for classifying SNe Ia has an efficiency of 0.96 and an SN Ia purity of 0.79. As a public resource for the future development of photometric SN classification and photo-z estimators, we have released updated simulations with improvements based on our experience from the SNPhotCC, added samples corresponding to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the SDSS-II, and provided the answer keys so that developers can evaluate their own analysis.},

	abstract = {We describe here the most ambitious survey currently planned in the optical, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The LSST design is driven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking an inventory of the solar system, exploring the transient optical sky, and mapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a large, wide-ﬁeld ground-based system designed to obtain repeated images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary mirror, a 9.6 deg2 ﬁeld of view, a 3.2-gigapixel camera, and six ﬁlters (ugrizy) covering the wavelength range 320–1050 nm. The project is in the construction phase and will begin regular survey operations by 2022. About 90\% of the observing time will be devoted to a deep-wide-fast survey mode that will uniformly observe a 18,000 deg2 region about 800 times (summed over all six bands) during the anticipated 10 yr of operations and will yield a co-added map to r∼27.5. These data will result in databases including about 32 trillion observations of 20 billion galaxies and a similar number of stars, and they will serve the majority of the primary science programs. The remaining 10\% of the observing time will be allocated to special projects such as Very Deep and Very Fast time domain surveys, whose details are currently under discussion. We illustrate how the LSST science drivers led to these choices of system parameters, and we describe the expected data products and their characteristics.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT We present a search for fast optical transients (τ ∼ 0.5 hr–1 day) using repeated observations of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium-Deep Survey (PS1/MDS) ﬁelds. Our search takes advantage of the consecutive gP1rP1 observations (16.5 minutes in each ﬁlter), by requiring detections in both bands, with non-detections on preceding and subsequent nights. We identify 19 transients brighter than 22.5 AB mag (S/N 10). Of these, 11 events exhibit quiescent counterparts in the deep PS1/MDS templates that we identify as M4–M9 dwarfs at d ≈ 0.2–1.2 kpc. The remaining eight transients lack quiescent counterparts, exhibit mild but signiﬁcant astrometric shifts between the gP1 and rP1 images, colors of (g − r)P1 ≈ 0.5–0.8 mag, non-varying light curves, and locations near the ecliptic plane with solar elongations of about 130◦, which are all indicative of main-belt asteroids near the stationary point of their orbits. With identiﬁcations for all 19 transients, we place an upper limit of RFOT(τ ∼ 0.5 hr) 0.12 deg−2 day−1 (95\% conﬁdence level) on the sky-projected rate of extragalactic fast transients at 22.5 mag, a factor of 30–50 times lower than previous limits; the limit for a timescale of ∼1 day is RFOT 2.4 × 10−3 deg−2 day−1. To convert these sky-projected rates to volumetric rates, we explore the expected peak luminosities of fast optical transients powered by various mechanisms, and ﬁnd that non-relativistic events are limited to M ≈ −10 to ≈−14 mag for a timescale of ∼0.5 hr to ∼1 day, while relativistic sources (e.g., gamma-ray bursts, magnetar-powered transients) can reach much larger luminosities. The resulting volumetric rates are 13 Mpc−3 yr−1 (M ≈ −10 mag), 0.05 Mpc−3 yr−1 (M ≈ −14 mag), and 10−6 Mpc−3 yr−1 (M ≈ −24 mag), signiﬁcantly above the nova, supernova, and gamma-ray burst rates, respectively, indicating that much larger surveys are required to provide meaningful constraints. Motivated by the results of our search, we discuss strategies for identifying fast optical transients in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope main survey, and reach the optimistic conclusion that the veil of foreground contaminants can be lifted with the survey data, without the need for expensive follow-up observations.},

	abstract = {Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are rare events, constituting only a few percent of all core-collapse SNe, and the current sample of well-observed SNe IIn is small. Here, we study the four SNe IIn observed by the Caltech CoreCollapse Project (CCCP). The CCCP SN sample is unbiased to the extent that object selection was not inﬂuenced by target SN properties. Therefore, these events are representative of the observed population of SNe IIn. We ﬁnd that a narrow P-Cygni proﬁle in the hydrogen Balmer lines appears to be a ubiquitous feature of SNe IIn. Our light curves show a relatively long rise time ({\textgreater}20 days) followed by a slow decline stage (0.01–0.15 mag day−1), and a typical V-band peak magnitude of MV = −18.4 ± 1.0 mag. We measure the progenitor star wind velocities (600–1400 km s−1) for the SNe in our sample and derive pre-explosion mass-loss rates (0.026–0.12 M yr−1). We compile similar data for SNe IIn from the literature and discuss our results in the context of this larger sample. Our results indicate that typical SNe IIn arise from progenitor stars that undergo luminous-blue-variable-like mass loss shortly before they explode.},

	abstract = {Under the assumption of a ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology, recent data from the Planck satellite point toward a Hubble constant that is in tension with that measured by gravitational lens time delays and by the local distance ladder. Prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic uncertainties in some of the measurements. More interestingly—if systematics were ruled out—resolving the tension would require a departure from the ﬂat ΛCDM cosmology, introducing, for example, a modest amount of spatial curvature, or a non-trivial dark energy equation of state. To begin to address these issues, we present an analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131−1231 that is improved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic error introduced by an assumed lens model density proﬁle. We use more ﬂexible gravitational lens models with baryonic and dark matter components, and ﬁnd that the exquisite Hubble Space Telescope image with thousands of intensity pixels in the Einstein ring and the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens contain sufﬁcient information to constrain these more ﬂexible models. The total uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.6\% for a single system. We proceed to combine our improved time-delay distance measurement with the WMAP9 and Planck posteriors. In an open ΛCDM model, the data for RXJ1131−1231 in combination with Planck favor a ﬂat universe with Ωk = 0.00−+00..0012 (68\% credible interval (CI)). In a ﬂat wCDM model, the combination of RXJ1131−1231 and Planck yields w = −1.52−+00..1290 (68\% CI).},

If veriﬁed, this would provide both precise and accurate time-delay measurements, making lensed type-Ia supernovae a new golden standard for time-delay cosmography. However, the 3D geometry of the expanding shell can introduce an additional bias that has not yet been fully explored. In this work, we present and discuss the impact of this eﬀect on time-delay cosmography with lensed supernovae and ﬁnd that on average it leads to a bias of a few tenths of a day for individual lensed systems. This is negligible in view of the cosmological time delays predicted for typical lensed type-Ia supernovae but not for the speciﬁc case of the recently discovered type-Ia supernova iPTF16geu, whose time delays are expected to be smaller than a day.},

	abstract = {Methods. To maximise the scope of this study, we do not specify a given cosmological model, but we reconstruct the expansion rate of the universe through a cubic spline interpolation ﬁtting the observations of the diﬀerent cosmological probes: SNIa, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the high-redshift information from the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Results. We show that when SNIa intrinsic luminosity is not allowed to vary as a function of redshift, cosmic acceleration is deﬁnitely proven in a model-independent approach. However, allowing for redshift dependence, a nonaccelerated reconstruction of the expansion rate is able to ﬁt, at the same level of ΛCDM, the combination of SNIa and BAO data, both treating the BAO standard ruler rd as a free parameter (not entering on the physics governing the BAO), and adding the recently published prior from CMB observations. We further extend the analysis by including the CMB data. In this case we also consider a third way to combine the diﬀerent probes by explicitly computing rd from the physics of the early universe, and we show that a nonaccelerated reconstruction is able to nicely ﬁt this combination of low- and high-redshift data. We also check that this reconstruction is compatible with the latest measurements of the growth rate of matter perturbations. We ﬁnally show that the value of the Hubble constant (H0) predicted by this reconstruction is in tension with model-independent measurements.
Conclusions. We present a model-independent reconstruction of a nonaccelerated expansion rate of the universe that is able to ﬁt all the main background cosmological probes nicely. However, the predicted value of H0 is in tension with recent direct measurements. Our analysis points out that a ﬁnal reliable and consensual value for H0 is critical to deﬁnitively prove cosmic acceleration in a model-independent way.},

The light curves imply an effective source-plane velocity of 10; 200 km sÀ1 P vehhM =M iÀ1=2 P 39; 600 km sÀ1 (68\% conﬁdence). Given an independent estimate for the source velocity, found by combining estimates for the peculiar velocity of the lens galaxy with its measured stellar velocity dispersion, we obtain a mean stellar mass of hM i ’ 0:037 h2 M  (0:0059 h2 M  P hM i P 0:20 h2 M ). We were unable to distinguish a Salpeter mass function from one in which all stars had the same mass, but we do ﬁnd a strong lower bound of  Ã=  k 0:5 on the fraction of the surface mass density represented by the microlenses. Our models favor a standard thin accretion disk model as the source structure over a simple Gaussian source.

	abstract = {Multi-epoch multi-wavelength spectroscopic observations of photospheric-phase type II supernovae (SN) provide information on massive-star progenitor properties, the core-collapse mechanism, and distances in the Universe. Following successes of recent endeavors (Dessart \& Hillier 2005a, A\&A, 437, 667; 2005b, A\&A, 439, 671) with the non-LTE model atmosphere code CMFGEN (Hillier \& Miller 1998, ApJ, 496, 407), we present a detailed quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the type II SN1999em and, using the Expanding Photosphere Method (EPM) or synthetic ﬁts to observed spectra, à la Baron et al. (2004, ApJ, 616, 91), we estimate its distance. Selecting eight epochs, which cover the ﬁrst 38 days after discovery, we obtain satisfactory ﬁts to optical spectroscopic observations of SN1999em (including the UV and near-IR ranges when available). We use the same iron-group metal content for the ejecta, the same power-law density distribution (with exponent n = 10−12), and a Hubble-velocity law at all times. We adopt a H/He/C/N/O abundance pattern compatible with CNO-cycle equilibrium values for a RSG/BSG progenitor, with C/O enhanced and N depleted at later times. The overall evolution of the spectral energy distribution, whose peak shifts to longer wavelengths as time progresses, reﬂects the steady temperature/ionization-level decrease of the ejecta, associated non-linearly with a dramatic shift to ions with stronger line-blocking powers in the UV and optical (Fe ii, Tiii). In the parameter space investigated, CMFGEN is very sensitive and provides photospheric temperatures and velocities, reddenings, and the H/He abundance ratio with an accuracy of ±500 K, ±10\%, 0.05 and 50\%, respectively. Following Leonard et al. (2002, PASP, 114, 35), and their use of correction factors from Hamuy et al. (2001, ApJ, 558, 615), we estimate an EPM distance to SN1999em that also falls 30\% short of the Cepheid distance of 11.7 Mpc to its host galaxy NGC 1637 (Leonard et al. 2003, ApJ, 594, 247). However, using the systematically higher correction factors of Dessart \& Hillier (2005b) removes the discrepancy. A signiﬁcant scatter, arising primarily from errors in the correction factors and derived temperatures, is seen in distances derived using diﬀerent band passes. However, adopting both correction factors and corresponding color-temperatures from tailored models to each observation leads to a good agreement between distance estimates obtained from diﬀerent band passes. The need for detailed model computations thus defeats the appeal and simplicity of the original EPM method, which uses tabulated correction factors and broadband ﬂuxes, for distance determinations. However, detailed ﬁts to SN optical spectra, based on tailored models for individual SN observations, oﬀers a promising approach to obtaining accurate distances, either through the EPM or via the technique of Baron et al. (2004). Our best distanceestimate to SN1999em is 11.5 ± 1.0 Mpc. We note that to achieve 10–20\% accuracy in such distance estimates requires multiple observations, covering preferentially a range of early epochs preceding the hydrogen-recombination phase.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, several rapidly evolving transients have been discovered whose timescales and luminosities are not easily explained by traditional supernovae (SNe) models. The sample size of these objects has remained small due, at least in part, to the challenges of detecting short timescale transients with traditional survey cadences. Here we present the results from a search within the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1-MDS) for rapidly evolving and luminous transients. We identify 10 new transients with a time above half-maximum (t1/2) of less than 12 days and −16.5 {\textgreater} M {\textgreater} −20 mag. This increases the number of known events in this region of SN phase space by roughly a factor of three. The median redshift of the PS1-MDS sample is z = 0.275 and they all exploded in star-forming galaxies. In general, the transients possess faster rise than decline timescale and blue colors at maximum light (gP1 − rP1 −0.2). Best-ﬁt blackbodies reveal photospheric temperatures/radii that expand/cool with time and explosion spectra taken near maximum light are dominated by a blue continuum, consistent with a hot, optically thick, ejecta. We ﬁnd it difﬁcult to reconcile the short timescale, high peak luminosity (L {\textgreater} 1043 erg s−1), and lack of UV line blanketing observed in many of these transients with an explosion powered mainly by the radioactive decay of 56Ni. Rather, we ﬁnd that many are consistent with either (1) cooling envelope emission from the explosion of a star with a low-mass extended envelope that ejected very little ({\textless}0.03 M ) radioactive material, or (2) a shock breakout within a dense, optically thick, wind surrounding the progenitor star. After calculating the detection efﬁciency for objects with rapid timescales in the PS1-MDS we ﬁnd a volumetric rate of 4800–8000 events yr−1 Gpc−3 (4\%–7\% of the core-collapse SN rate at z = 0.2).},

	abstract = {We examine the effect that the shape of the source brightness proﬁle has on the magnitude ﬂuctuations of images in quasar lens systems due to microlensing. We do this by convolving a variety of accretion disk models (including Gaussian disks, uniform disks, ‘‘cones,’’ and a Shakura-Sunyaev thermal model ) with two magniﬁcation maps in the source plane, one with convergence   ¼ 0:4 and shear   ¼ 0:4 (positive parity) and the other with   ¼   ¼ 0:6 (negative parity). By looking at magniﬁcation histograms of the convolutions and using  2 tests to determine the number of observations that would be necessary to distinguish histograms associated with different disk models, we ﬁnd that, for circular disk models, the microlensing ﬂuctuations are relatively insensitive to all properties of the models except the half-light radius of the disk. Shakura-Sunyaev models are sufﬁciently well constrained by observed quasar properties that we can estimate the half-light radius at optical wavelengths for a typical quasar. If Shakura-Sunyaev models are appropriate, the half-light radii are very much smaller than the Einstein rings of intervening stars, and the quasar can be reasonably taken to be a point source except in the immediate vicinity of caustic-crossing events.},

	abstract = {We have acquired Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Very Large Telescope near-infrared spectra and images of supernova (SN) Refsdal after its discovery as an Einstein cross in fall 2014. The HST light curve of SN Refsdal has a shape consistent with the distinctive, slowly rising light curves of SN1987A-like SNe, and we ﬁnd strong evidence for a broad Hα P-Cygni proﬁle and Na I D absorption in the HST grism spectrum at the redshift (z = 1.49) of the spiral host galaxy. SNeIIn, largely powered by circumstellar interaction, could provide a good match to the light curve of SN Refsdal, but the spectrum of a SN IIn would not show broad and strong Hα and Na I D absorption. From the grism spectrum, we measure an Hα expansion velocity consistent with those of SN1987Alike SNe at a similar phase. The luminosity, evolution, and Gaussian proﬁle of the Hα emission of the WFC3 and X-shooter spectra, separated by ∼2.5 months in the rest frame, provide additional evidence that supports the SN1987A-like classiﬁcation. In comparison with other examples of SN1987A-like SNe, photometry of SN Refsdal favors bluer B−V and V−R colors and one of the largest luminosities for the assumed range of potential magniﬁcations. The evolution of the light curve at late times will provide additional evidence about the potential existence of any substantial circumstellar material. Using MOSFIRE and X-shooter spectra, we estimate a subsolar host-galaxy metallicity (8.3 ± 0.1 dex and {\textless}8.4 dex, respectively) near the explosion site.},

These can be used to construct rest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yield distance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-rate corrections than in the optical. However, working with NIR observed and i-band rest-frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated the development of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyze both the low-z and high-z CSP sample. We present in this paper the methods used to generate uBVgriYJH light-curve templates based on a sample of 24 high-quality low-z CSP SNe. We also present two methods for determining the distances to the hosts of SN Ia events. A larger sample of 30 low-z SNe Ia in the Hubble ﬂow is used to calibrate these methods. We then apply the method and derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motions are not dominated by the Hubble ﬂow.},

	abstract = {Supernovae are essential to understanding the chemical evolution of the universe. Type Ia supernovae also provide the most powerful observational tool currently available for studying the expansion history of the universe and the nature of dark energy. Our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the study of their photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, the presently available data sets of optical and nearinfrared light curves of supernovae are rather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that are poorly characterized. Similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whose spectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, with precise spectrophotometric observations. The low-redshift portion of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) seeks to remedy this situation by providing photometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken on telescope/ﬁlter/detector systems that are well understood and well characterized. During a 5 year program that began in 2004 September, we expect to obtain high-precision uЈgЈrЈiЈBVYJHKs light curves and optical spectrophotometry for about 250 supernovae of all types. In this paper we provide a detailed description of the CSP survey observing and data reduction methodology. In addition, we present preliminary photometry and spectra obtained for a few representative supernovae during the ﬁrst observing campaign.},

Imaging was obtained from X-ray to radio wavelengths, and a comprehensive set of multi-band (w2m2w1u g r i UBVYJHKs) light curves and optical spectroscopy is presented. A virtually complete bolometric light curve is derived, from which we infer a 56Ni mass of 0.06 M . The early spectrum strongly resembles SN 2005bf and exhibits high-velocity features of Ca ii and Hα; during late epochs the spectrum shows evidence of an ejecta-wind interaction. Nebular emission lines have similar widths and exhibit proﬁles that indicate a lack of major asymmetry in the ejecta. Late phase spectra are modeled with a non-LTE code, from which we ﬁnd 56Ni, O, and total-ejecta masses (excluding He) to be 0.06, 0.2, and 0.42 M , respectively, below 4500 km s−1. The 56Ni mass conﬁrms results obtained from the bolometric light curve. The oxygen abundance suggests that the progenitor was most likely a ≈3.3 M He core star that evolved from a zero-age-main-sequence mass of 10–13 M . The explosion energy is determined to be ≈1050 erg, and the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is constrained from X-ray and radio observations to be 10−6 M yr−1.

These superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) have been a focus of intensive study. I review the accumulated observations and discuss the implications for the physics of these extreme explosions. ▪ SLSNe can be classified into hydrogen-poor (SLSNe-I) and hydrogen-rich (SLSNe-II) events. ▪ Combining photometric and spectroscopic analysis of samples of nearby SLSNe-I and lower-luminosity events, a threshold of mag at peak appears to separate SLSNe-I from the normal population. ▪ SLSN-I light curves can be quite complex, presenting both early bumps and late postpeak undulations. ▪ SLSNe-I spectroscopically evolve from an early hot photospheric phase with a blue continuum and weak absorption lines, through a cool photospheric phase resembling spectra of SNe Ic, and into the late nebular phase. ▪ SLSNe-II are not nearly as well studied, lacking information based on large-sample studies. Proposed models for the SLSN power source are challenged to explain all the observations. SLSNe arise from massive progenitors, with some events associated with very massive stars ( M). Host galaxies of SLSNe in the nearby Universe tend to have low mass and subsolar metallicity. SLSNe are rare, with rates {\textless}100 times lower than ordinary supernovae. SLSN cosmology and their use as beacons to study the high-redshift Universe offer exciting prospects.},

The improved observing strategy and advanced data reduction results in datacubes with sub-arcsecond spatial resolution (0 . 65 at 7000 Å) and accurate astrometry (0 . 07 rms). We compare the broadband photometric properties of the datacubes to HST photometry, ﬁnding a good agreement in zeropoint up to mAB = 28 but with an increasing scatter for faint objects. We have investigated the noise properties and developed an empirical way to account for the impact of the correlation introduced by the 3D drizzle interpolation. The achieved 3σ emission line detection limit for a point source is 1.5 and 3.1 × 10−19 erg s−1 cm−2 for the single ultra-deep datacube and the mosaic, respectively. We extracted 6288 sources using an optimal extraction scheme that takes the published HST source locations as prior. In parallel, we performed a blind search of emission line galaxies using an original method based on advanced test statistics and ﬁlter matching. The blind search results in 1251 emission line galaxy candidates in the mosaic and 306 in the ultradeep datacube, including 72 sources without HST counterparts (mAB {\textgreater} 31). In addition 88 sources missed in the HST catalog but with clear HST counterparts were identiﬁed. This data set is the deepest spectroscopic survey ever performed. In just over 100 h of integration time, it provides nearly an order of magnitude more spectroscopic redshifts compared to the data that has been accumulated on the UDF over the past decade. The depth and high quality of these datacubes enables new and detailed studies of the physical properties of the galaxy population and their environments over a large redshift range.},

	abstract = {Time delays of gravitationally lensed sources can be used to constrain the mass model of a deﬂector and determine cosmological parameters. We here present an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply imaged sources behind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with well-calibrated mass models. We ﬁnd that for time delays less than 1000 days, at z = 3.0, their logarithmic probability distribution functions are well represented by P (log ∆t) = 5.3 × 10−4∆tβ/M225β0, with β = 0.77, where M250 is the projected cluster mass inside 250 kpc (in 1014M⊙), and β is the power-law slope of the distribution. The resultant probability distribution function enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensing cluster of known mass. For a cluster with M250 = 2×1014M⊙, the fraction of time delays less than 1000 days is approximately 3\%. Taking Abell 1689 as an example, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity dispersions σ 500 km s−1, mainly produce large time delays, while galaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. We estimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in the known images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of estimating the supernova rate is applied in this work. For a magnitude threshold of mAB = 26.5, the yearly rate of Type Ia (corecollapse) supernovae with time delays less than 1000 days is 0.004 ± 0.002 (0.029 ± 0.001). If the magnitude threshold is lowered to mAB ∼ 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae suitable for time delay observation is 0.044 ± 0.015 per year.},

	abstract = {Recently, using a large low-redshift sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), we discovered a relation between SN Ia ejecta velocity and intrinsic color that improves the distance precision of SNe Ia and reduces potential systematic biases related to dust reddening. No SN Ia cosmological results have yet made a correction for the “velocity–color” relation. To test the existence of such a relation and constrain its properties at high redshift, we examine a sample of 75 SNe Ia discovered and observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey and Supernova Legacy Survey. From each spectrum, we measure ejecta velocities at maximum brightness for the Ca H\&K and Si ii λ6355 features, vC0a H\&K and vS0i ii, respectively. Using SN light curve parameters, we determine the intrinsic Bmax − Vmax for each SN. Similar to what was found at low redshift, we ﬁnd that SNe Ia with higher ejecta velocity tend to be intrinsically redder than SNe Ia with lower ejecta velocity. The distributions of ejecta velocities for SNe Ia at low and high redshift are similar, indicating that current cosmological results should have little bias related to the velocity–color relation. Additionally, we ﬁnd a slight (2.4σ signiﬁcant) trend between SN Ia ejecta velocity and host-galaxy mass such that SNe Ia in high-mass host galaxies tend to have lower ejecta velocities as probed by vC0a H\&K. These results emphasize the importance of spectroscopy for SN Ia cosmology.},

	abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II Supernova Survey has identiﬁed a large number of new transient sources in a 300 deg2 region along the celestial equator during its ﬁrst two seasons of a three-season campaign. Multiband (ugriz) light curves were measured for most of the sources, which include solar system objects, galactic variable stars, active galactic nuclei, supernovae (SNe), and other astronomical transients. The imaging survey is augmented by an extensive spectroscopic follow-up program to identify SNe, measure their redshifts, and study the physical conditions of the explosions and their environment through spectroscopic diagnostics. During the survey, light curves are rapidly evaluated to provide an initial photometric type of the SNe, and a selected sample of sources are targeted for spectroscopic observations. In the ﬁrst two seasons, 476 sources were selected for spectroscopic observations, of which 403 were identiﬁed as SNe. For the type Ia SNe, the main driver for the survey, our photometric typing and targeting efﬁciency is 90\%. Only 6\% of the photometric SN Ia candidates were spectroscopically classiﬁed as non-SN Ia instead, and the remaining 4\% resulted in low signal-to-noise, unclassiﬁed spectra. This paper describes the search algorithm and the software, and the realtime processing of the SDSS imaging data. We also present the details of the supernova candidate selection procedures and strategies for follow-up spectroscopic and imaging observations of the discovered sources.},

The survey region is a stripe 2.5◦ wide centered on the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap that has been imaged numerous times in earlier years, enabling construction of a deep reference image for the discovery of new objects. Supernova imaging observations are being acquired between September 1 and November 30 of 2005–7. During the ﬁrst two seasons, each region was imaged on average every ﬁve nights. Spectroscopic follow-up observations to determine supernova type and redshift are carried out on a large number of telescopes. In its ﬁrst two three-month seasons, the survey has discovered and measured light curves for 327 spectroscopically conﬁrmed SNe Ia, 30 probable SNe Ia, 14 conﬁrmed SNe Ib/c, 32 conﬁrmed SNe II, plus a large number of photometrically identiﬁed SNe Ia, 94 of which have host-galaxy spectra taken so far.

	abstract = {In recent years, wide-ﬁeld sky surveys providing deep multiband imaging have presented a new path for indirectly characterizing the progenitor populations of core-collapse supernovae (SNe): systematic light-curve studies. We assemble a set of 76 grizy-band Type IIP SN light curves from Pan-STARRS1, obtained over a constant survey program of 4 yr and classiﬁed using both spectroscopy and machine-learning-based photometric techniques. We develop and apply a new Bayesian model for the full multiband evolution of each light curve in the sample. We ﬁnd no evidence of a subpopulation of fast-declining explosions (historically referred to as “Type IIL” SNe). However, we identify a highly signiﬁcant relation between the plateau phase decay rate and peak luminosity among our SNe IIP. These results argue in favor of a single parameter, likely determined by initial stellar mass, predominantly controlling the explosions of red supergiants. This relation could also be applied for SN cosmology, offering a standardizable candle good to an intrinsic scatter of 0.2 mag. We compare each light curve to physical models from hydrodynamic simulations to estimate progenitor initial masses and other properties of the Pan-STARRS1 Type IIP SN sample. We show that correction of systematic discrepancies between modeled and observed SN IIP light-curve properties and an expanded grid of progenitor properties are needed to enable robust progenitor inferences from multiband light-curve samples of this kind. This work will serve as a pathﬁnder for photometric studies of core-collapse SNe to be conducted through future wide-ﬁeld transient searches.},

Several sharp quasar variability features strongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. Using three diﬀerent numerical techniques, we measured these delays for all possible pairs of quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously. For all three methods, the delays between the three close images A, B, and C are compatible with being 0, while we measured the delay of image D to be 91 days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5\% (1σ), including systematic errors. Our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realistic way for the observed quasar variability, ﬂuctuating microlensing magniﬁcation over a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps.

The redshifts of these SNe—0.027 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.144—cover a range hitherto sparsely sampled in the literature; in particular, our SNe II-P sample contains nearly as many SNe in the Hubble ﬂow (z {\textgreater} 0.01) as all of the current literature on the SCM combined. We ﬁnd that the SDSS SNe have a very small intrinsic I-band dispersion (0.22 mag), which can be attributed to selection effects. When the SCM is applied to the combined SDSS-plus-literature set of SNe II-P, the dispersion increases to 0.29 mag, larger than the scatter for either set of SNe separately. We show that the standardization cannot be further improved by eliminating SNe with positive plateau decline rates, as proposed in Poznanski et al. We thoroughly examine all potential systematic effects and conclude that for the SCM to be useful for cosmology, the methods currently used to determine the Fe ii velocity at day 50 must be improved, and spectral templates able to encompass the intrinsic variations of Type II-P SNe will be needed.},

Flux ratios between close pairs of images of lensed quasars can be used to constrain the accretion disc size and temperature proﬁle. The starting point of any microlensing model is the macromodel of the lens, which provides the convergence and shear values at the location of the multiple images. Here I present a new approach of microlensing modelling independently of the macromodel of the lens. The technique is applied to the close pair of images A1 and A2 of MG 0414+0534, for a set of ﬂux ratios with large variation with respect to wavelength. The inferred accretion disc size and temperature proﬁle measurements, as well as the smooth matter fraction at the location of the images, are quite robust under a wide range of macromodel variations. A case of using purely microlensing data (ﬂux ratios) to constrain the macromodel is also presented. This is a ﬁrst application of the technique on a ﬁducial system and set of ﬂux ratios; the method is readily applicable to collections of such objects and can be extended to light-curve and/or imaging data.},

We investigated the correlations of the intrinsic luminosity with light-curve decline rate, color index, and SN environmental parameters. In particular, we found that SNe Ia in E/S0 galaxies close to the central region are brighter than those in the outer region, which may suggest a possible metallicity effect on SN luminosity. The dependence of SN luminosity on galactic environment disappears after corrections for the extinction and ÁC12. The Hubble diagrams constructed using 73 Hubble ﬂow SNe Ia yield a 1   scatter of P0.12 mag in BVI bands and \$0.16 mag in U band. The luminosity difference between normal SNe Ia and peculiar objects (including SN 1991bg–like and SN 1991T–like events) has now been reduced to within 0.15 mag via ÁC12 correction. We use the same precepts to correct the nearby SNe Ia with Cepheid distances and found that the fully corrected absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia are MB ¼ À19:33 Æ 0:06 and MV ¼ À19:27 Æ 0:05.

	abstract = {We present an updated analysis of the intrinsic colors of Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) using the latest data release of the Carnegie Supernova Project. We introduce a new light-curve parameter very similar to stretch that is better suited for fast-declining events, and ﬁnd that these peculiar types can be seen as extensions to the population of “normal” SNe Ia. With a larger number of objects, an updated ﬁt to the Lira relation is presented along with evidence for a dependence on the late-time slope of the B − V light-curves with stretch and color. Using the full wavelength range from u to H band, we place constraints on the reddening law for the sample as a whole and also for individual events/hosts based solely on the observed colors. The photometric data continue to favor low values of RV , though with large variations from event to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. We conﬁrm the ﬁndings of other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derived reddening law, RV , and the color excess, E(B − V ), such that larger E(B − V ) tends to favor lower RV . The intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatter that cannot be explained by variations in RV or by the Goobar power-law for circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features of the supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.},

We ﬁnd that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations, including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magniﬁcation of 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the ﬁne structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness proﬁle. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial proﬁle of the best-ﬁt mass model is in good agreement with a mass proﬁle inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being 1, a clear dependence of the predicted A–D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

	abstract = {The detailed observation of the distribution of redshifts and chirp masses of binary black hole (BH) mergers is expected to provide a clue to their origin. In this paper, we develop a hybrid model of the probability distribution function of gravitational lensing magniﬁcation taking account of both strong and weak gravitational lensing, and use it to study the effect of gravitational lensing magniﬁcation on the distribution of gravitational waves from distant binary BH mergers detected in ongoing and future gravitational wave observations. We ﬁnd that the effect of gravitational lensing magniﬁcation is signiﬁcant at high ends of observed chirp mass and redshift distributions. While a high-mass tail in the observed chirp mass distribution is produced by highly magniﬁed gravitational lensing events, we ﬁnd that highly demagniﬁed images of strong lensing events produce a high-redshift (zobs 15) tail in the observed redshift distribution, which can easily be observed in the third-generation gravitational wave observatories. Such a demagniﬁed, apparently high-redshift event is expected to be accompanied by a magniﬁed image that is observed typically 10–100 days before the demagniﬁed image. For highly magniﬁed events that produce apparently very high chirp masses, we expect pairs of events with similar magniﬁcations with time delays typically less than a day. This work suggests the critical importance of gravitational lensing (de-)magniﬁcation on the interpretation of apparently very high mass or redshift gravitational wave events.},

	abstract = {We present an updated version of the multicolor light-curve shape method to measure distances to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), incorporating new procedures for K-correction and extinction corrections. We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SNe Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble ﬂow (cz ! 2500 km sÀ1), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7\% in distance. The Hubble ﬂow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SNe Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We ﬁnd that the Hubble ﬂow SNe with H0dSN ! 7400 km sÀ1 yield an expansion rate that is 6:5\% Æ 1:8\% lower than the rate determined from SNe within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SNe Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the cosmic microwave background. Direct ﬁts of SNe Ia that are signiﬁcantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest that their mean extinction law may be described by RV ’ 2:7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on RV .},

	abstract = {Supernovae are important probes of the properties of stars at high redshifts because they can be detected at early epochs and their masses can be inferred from their light curves. Finding the first cosmic explosions in the universe will only be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes. But strong gravitational lensing by massive clusters, like those in the Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH), could reveal such events now by magnifying their flux by factors of 10 or more. We find that CLASH will likely discover at least 2 - 3 core-collapse supernovae at 5 {\textless} z {\textless} 12 and perhaps as many as ten. Future surveys of cluster lenses similar in scope to CLASH by the James Webb Space Telescope might find hundreds of these events out to z {\textasciitilde} 15 - 17. Besides revealing the masses of early stars, these ancient supernovae will also constrain cosmic star formation rates in the era of first galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We present 32 epochs of optical (3300−9700 Å) spectrophotometric observations of the nearby quintessential “normal” type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2011fe in the galaxy M101, extending from −15 to +97 d with respect to B-band maximum, obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. SN 2011fe is the closest (µ = 29.04) and brightest (Bmax = 9.94 mag) SN Ia observed since the advent of modern large scale programs for the intensive periodic followup of supernovae. Both synthetic light curve measurements and spectral feature analysis attest to the normality of SN 2011fe. There is very little evidence for reddening in its host galaxy. The homogeneous calibration, intensive time sampling, and high signal-to-noise ratio of the data set make it unique. Thus it is ideal for studying the physics of SN Ia explosions in detail, and for furthering the use of SNe Ia as standardizable candles for cosmology. Several such applications are shown, from the creation of a bolometric light curve and measurement of the 56Ni mass, to the simulation of detection thresholds for unburned carbon, direct comparisons with other SNe Ia, and existing spectral templates.},

This sample consists of SN candidates with no spectroscopic conﬁrmation, with a subset of 210 candidates having spectroscopic redshifts of their host galaxies measured while the remaining 860 candidates are purely photometric in their identiﬁcation. We describe a method for estimating the efﬁciency and purity of photometric SN Ia classiﬁcation when spectroscopic conﬁrmation of only a limited sample is available, and demonstrate that SN Ia candidates from SDSS-II can be identiﬁed photometrically with ∼91\% efﬁciency and with a contamination of ∼6\%. Although this is the largest uniform sample of SN candidates to date for studying photometric identiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that a larger spectroscopic sample of contaminating sources is required to obtain a better characterization of the background events. A Hubble diagram using SN candidates with no spectroscopic conﬁrmation, but with host galaxy spectroscopic redshifts, yields a distance modulus dispersion that is only ∼20\%–40\% larger than that of the spectroscopically conﬁrmed SN Ia sample alone with no signiﬁcant bias. A Hubble diagram with purely photometric classiﬁcation and redshift-distance measurements, however, exhibits biases that require further investigation for precision cosmology.},

Subsequent reexamination of early ground-based observations revealed that a faint OT was present 6 hr after burst, conﬁrming the source association with GRB 020410. A deep nondetection after one week requires that the OT rebrightened between day 7 and day 28, and further late-time HST data taken approximately 100 days after burst imply that it is very red (F  /  À2:7). We compare both the ﬂux and color of the excess with supernova models and show that the data are best explained by the presence of a Type Ib/c supernova at a redshift z \% 0:5, which occurred roughly coincident with the day of the GRB.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of a transient source in the central regions of galaxy cluster A267. The object, which we call ‘‘PALS-1,’’ was found in a survey aimed at identifying highly magniﬁed Lyman break galaxies in the ﬁelds of intervening rich clusters. At discovery, the source had Un {\textgreater} 24:7 (2  ; AB), g ¼ 21:96 Æ 0:12, and very blue g À r and r À i colors; i.e., PALS-1 was a ‘‘U-band dropout,’’ characteristic of star-forming galaxies and quasars at z \$ 3. However, 3 months later the source had faded by more than 3 mag. Further observations showed a continued decline in luminosity, to R {\textgreater} 26:4 at 7 months after discovery. Although the apparent brightness suggests a supernova at roughly the cluster redshift, we show that the photometry and light curve argue against any known type of supernova at any redshift. The spectral energy distribution and location near the center of a galaxy cluster are consistent with the hypothesis that PALS-1 is a gravitationally lensed transient at z \% 3:3. If this interpretation is correct, the source is magniﬁed by a factor of 4–7, and two counterimages are predicted. Our lens model predicts that there are time delays between the three images of 1–10 yr and that we have witnessed the ﬁnal occurrence of the transient. The intense luminosity (MAB \$ À23:5 after correcting for lensing) and blue UV continuum (implying T k 50; 000 K) argue that the source may have been a ﬂare resulting from the tidal disruption of a star by a 106–108 M  black hole. Regardless of its physical nature, PALS-1 highlights the importance of monitoring regions of high magniﬁcation in galaxy clusters for distant time-varying phenomena.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the diversity of V-band light-curves of hydrogen-rich type II supernovae. Analyzing a sample of 116 supernovae, several magnitude measurements are deﬁned, together with decline rates at different epochs, and time durations of different phases. It is found that magnitudes measured at maximum light correlate more strongly with decline rates than those measured at other epochs: brighter supernovae at maximum generally have faster declining light-curves at all epochs. We ﬁnd a relation between the decline rate during the “plateau” phase and peak magnitudes, which has a dispersion of 0.56 mag, offering the prospect of using type II supernovae as purely photometric distance indicators. Our analysis suggests that the type II population spans a continuum from low-luminosity events which have ﬂat light-curves during the “plateau” stage, through to the brightest events which decline much faster. A large range in optically thick phase durations is observed, implying a range in progenitor envelope masses at the epoch of explosion. During the radioactive tails, we ﬁnd many supernovae with faster declining light-curves than expected from full trapping of radioactive emission, implying low mass ejecta. It is suggested that the main driver of light-curve diversity is the extent of hydrogen envelopes retained before explosion. Finally, a new classiﬁcation scheme is introduced where hydrogen-rich events are typed as simply “SN II” with an “s2” value giving the decline rate during the “plateau” phase, indicating its morphological type.},

In light of these difﬁculties, the diversity of SNe II is not fully understood. Here we present ultraviolet and optical photometry of 12 SNe II monitored by the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network during 2013 to 2014, and compare them with previously studied SNe having well-sampled light curves. We explore SN II diversity by searching for correlations between the slope of the linear light-curve decay after maximum light (historically used to divide SNe II into IIL and IIP) and other measured physical properties. While SNe IIL are found to be on average more luminous than SNe IIP, SNe IIL do not appear to synthesize more 56Ni than SNe IIP. Finally, optical nebular spectra obtained for several SNe in our sample are found to be consistent with models of red supergiant progenitors in the 12–16 M range. Consequently, SNe IIL appear not to account for the deﬁcit of massive red supergiants as SN II progenitors.},

	abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) was a multi-cycle treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that surveyed a total area of ∼0.25 deg2 with ∼900 HST orbits spread across ﬁve ﬁelds over three years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae (SNe) of all types, out to z ∼ 2.5. We classify ∼24 of these as Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of six SNe). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the ﬁrst time beyond z = 2 and putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SNe that exploded when the universe was only ∼3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history. This gives the CANDELS high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SNe Ia that explode promptly after formation ({\textless}500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we ﬁnd that this prompt SN Ia fraction is fP = 0.53sta±t00..1009sy±s00..2160, consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t−1 power law for all times t {\textgreater} 40 Myr. However, mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble), we ﬁnd a low rate of SNe Ia at z {\textgreater} 1. This could be a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only 20\% of all SN Ia explosions—though further analysis and larger samples will be needed to examine that suggestion.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ∼N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

	abstract = {The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will detect many strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) for timedelay cosmography. This will provide an independent and direct way for measuring the Hubble constant H0, which is necessary to address the current 4.4σ tension in H0 between the local distance ladder and the early Universe measurements. We present a detailed analysis of diﬀerent observing strategies (also referred to as cadence strategy) for the LSST, and quantify their impact on time-delay measurement between multiple images of LSNe Ia. For this, we simulated observations by using mock LSNe Ia for which we produced mock-LSST light curves that account for microlensing. Furthermore, we used the free-knot splines estimator from the software PyCS to measure the time delay from the simulated observations. We ﬁnd that using only LSST data for time-delay cosmography is not ideal. Instead, we advocate using LSST as a discovery machine for LSNe Ia, enabling time delay measurements from follow-up observations from other instruments in order to increase the number of systems by a factor of 2–16 depending on the observing strategy. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that LSST observing strategies, which provide a good sampling frequency (the mean internight gap is around two days) and high cumulative season length (ten seasons with a season length of around 170 days per season), are favored. Rolling cadences subdivide the survey and focus on diﬀerent parts in diﬀerent years; these observing strategies trade the number of seasons for better sampling frequency. In our investigation, this leads to half the number of systems in comparison to the best observing strategy. Therefore rolling cadences are disfavored because the gain from the increased sampling frequency cannot compensate for the shortened cumulative season length. We anticipate that the sample of lensed SNe Ia from our preferred LSST cadence strategies with rapid follow-up observations would yield an independent percent-level constraint on H0.},

Using HST and Keck AO reference images taken after the SN faded, we obtain a total lensing magniﬁcation for iPTF16geu of μ = 67.8+−22..69, accounting for extinction in the host and lensing galaxy. As expected from the symmetry of the system, we measure very short time-delays for the three fainter images with respect to the brightest one: −0.23 ± 0.99, −1.43 ± 0.74, and 1.36 ± 1.07 d. Interestingly, we ﬁnd large differences between the magniﬁcations of the four supernova images, even after accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections: m1 = −3.88+−00..0076, m2 = −2.99+−00..0098, m3 = −2.19+−00..1145, and m4 = −2.40+−00..1142 mag, discrepant with model predictions suggesting similar image brightnesses. A possible explanation for the large differences is gravitational lensing by substructures, micro- or millilensing, in addition to the large-scale lens causing the image separations. We ﬁnd that the inferred magniﬁcation is insensitive to the assumptions about the dust properties in the host and lens galaxy.},

	abstract = {Stellar kinematics provide insights into the masses and formation histories of galaxies. At high redshifts, spatially resolving the stellar kinematics of quiescent galaxies is challenging due to their compact sizes. Using deep nearinfrared spectroscopy, we have measured the resolved stellar kinematics of four quiescent galaxies at z=1.95–2.64, introduced in PaperI, that are gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters. Analyses of two of these have previously been reported individually by Newman et al.and Toft et al., and for the latter, we present new observations. All four galaxies show signiﬁcant rotation and can be classiﬁed as “fast rotators.” In the three systems for which the lensing constraints permit a reconstruction of the source, we ﬁnd that all are likely to be highly ﬂattened (intrinsic ellipticities of ≈0.75–0.85) disk-dominated galaxies with rapid rotation speeds of Vmax=290–352kms−1 and predominantly rotational support, as indicated by the ratio (V s)Re = 1.7–2.3. Compared to coeval star-forming galaxies of similar mass, the quiescent galaxies have smaller V/σ. Given their high masses, Mdyn  2 ´ 1011 M, we argue that these galaxies are likely to evolve into “slow rotator” elliptical galaxies whose speciﬁc angular momentum is reduced by a factor of 5–10. This provides strong evidence for merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies after quenching. Consistent with indirect evidence from earlier morphological studies, our small but unique sample suggests that the kinematic transformations that produced round, dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies were not generally coincident with quenching. Such galaxies probably emerged later via mergers that increased their masses and sizes while also eroding their rotational support.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the advantages of observing at near-IR wavelengths, we investigate Type II supernovae (SNe II) as distance indicators at those wavelengths through the Photospheric Magnitude Method (PMM). For the analysis, we use BVIJH photometry and optical spectroscopy of 24 SNe II during the photospheric phase. To correct photometry for extinction and redshift effects, we compute total-to-selective broad-band extinction ratios and K-corrections up to z = 0.032. To estimate host galaxy colour excesses, we use the colour–colour curve method with the V–I versus B–V as colour combination. We calibrate the PMM using four SNe II in galaxies having Tip of the Red Giant Branch distances. Among our 24 SNe II, nine are at cz {\textgreater} 2000 km s−1, which we use to construct Hubble diagrams (HDs). To further explore the PMM distance precision, we include into HDs the four SNe used for calibration and other two in galaxies with Cepheid and SN Ia distances. With a set of 15 SNe II we obtain an HD rms of 0.13 mag for the J-band, which compares to the rms of 0.15–0.26 mag for optical bands. This reﬂects the beneﬁts of measuring PMM distances with near-IR instead of optical photometry. With the evidence we have, we can set the PMM distance precision with J-band below 10 per cent with a conﬁdence level of 99 per cent.},

We calibrate this standardization using SNe II with host galaxy distances measured using Cepheids, and a well-constrained shock breakout epoch and extinction due to the host galaxy. We estimate the reddening with an analysis of the B −V versus V −I color–color curves, similar to that of Natali et al. With four SNe II meeting the above requirements, we build a photospheric magnitude versus color diagram (similar to an H-R diagram) with a dispersion of 0.29 mag. We also show that when using time since shock breakout instead of color as the independent variable, the same standardization gives a dispersion of 0.09 mag. Moreover, we show that the above time-based standardization corresponds to the generalization of the standardized candle method of Hamuy \& Pinto for various epochs throughout the photospheric phase. To test the new tool, we construct Hubble diagrams for different subsamples of 50 low-redshift (cz {\textless} 104 km s−1) SNe II. For 13 SNe within the Hubble ﬂow (czCMB {\textgreater} 3000 km s−1) and with a well-constrained shock breakout epoch we obtain values of 68–69 km s−1 Mpc−1 for the Hubble constant and a mean intrinsic scatter of 0.12 mag or 6\% in relative distances.},

The occurrence of SN 2013eq in the Hubble ﬂow (z = 0.041 ± 0.001) prompted us to investigate the implications of the diﬀerence between “angular” and “luminosity” distances within the framework of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) that relies upon a relation between ﬂux and angular size to yield a distance. Following a re-derivation of the basic equations of the EPM for SNe at non-negligible redshifts, we conclude that the EPM results in an angular distance. The observed ﬂux should be converted into the SN rest frame and the angular size, θ, has to be corrected by a factor of (1 + z)2. Alternatively, the EPM angular distance can be converted to a luminosity distance by implementing a modiﬁcation of the angular size. For SN 2013eq, we ﬁnd EPM luminosity distances of DL = 151 ± 18 Mpc and DL = 164 ± 20 Mpc by making use of diﬀerent sets of dilution factors taken from the literature. Application of the standardized candle method for Type II-P SNe results in an independent luminosity distance estimate (DL = 168 ± 16 Mpc) that is consistent with the EPM estimate.},

The photometric data and the distance from our own analysis are used to construct the supernova’s bolometric light curve. Using the bolometric light curve, we estimate SN 1992am ejected approximately 0.30. i\#o °f 56Ni, an amount four times larger than that of other well studied SNe II. SN 1992amis; host galaxy lies at a redshift of cz = 14 600 km s-1, making it one of the most distant SNe II discovered, and an important application of the Expanding Photosphere Method. Since z=0.05 is large enough for redshift-dependent effects to matter, we develop the technique to derive luminosity distances with the Expanding Photosphere Method at any redshift, and apply this method to SN 1992am. The derived distance, D=180Í25 Mpc, is independent of all other rungs in the extragalactic distance ladder. The redshift of SN Jl992am’s host galaxy is sufficiently large that uncertainties due to perturbations in the smooth Hubble flo{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum} should be smaller than 10\%.

	abstract = {Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are the classic variety of core-collapse events that result from isolated, massive stars with thick hydrogen envelopes intact at the time of explosion. Their distances are now routinely estimated through two techniques: the expanding photosphere method (EPM), a primary distance-determining method, and the recently developed standard-candle method (SCM), a promising secondary technique. Using Cycle 10 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we identify 41 Cepheid variable stars in NGC 1637, the host galaxy of the most thoroughly studied SN II-P to date, SN 1999em. Remarkably, the Cepheid distance that we derive to NGC 1637, D ¼ 11:7 Æ 1:0 Mpc, is nearly 50\% larger than earlier EPM distance estimates to SN 1999em. This is the ﬁrst direct comparison between these two primary distance-determining methods for a galaxy hosting a well-observed, spectroscopically and photometrically normal, SN II-P. Extensive consistency checks show strong evidence to support the Cepheid distance scale, so we are led to believe either that SN 1999em is in some heretofore unsuspected way an unusual SN II-P, or that the SN II-P distance scale must be revised. Assuming the latter, this one calibration yields H0ðEPMÞ ¼ 57 Æ 15 km sÀ1 MpcÀ1 and H0ðSCMÞ ¼ 59 Æ 11 km sÀ1 MpcÀ1; additional calibrating galaxies are clearly desirable in order to test the robustness of both determinations of H0. The HST observations of NGC 1637 also captured the fading SN 1999em 2 yr after explosion, providing the latest photometry ever obtained for an SN II-P. The nebularphase photometric behavior of SN 1999em closely follows that observed for SN 1987A at similar epochs. The V and I light curves are both declining at rates signiﬁcantly greater than the decay slope of 56Co predicts. This is likely due to an increasing transparency of the envelope to gamma rays and perhaps also to the formation of dust in the cooling atmosphere of the SN. The absolute V-band brightness of SN 1999em is \$0.25 mag brighter than SN 1987A at the same epochs, which suggests that a slightly greater amount of radioactive 56Ni, \$0.09 M , was ejected by SN 1999em than was derived for SN 1987A (0.075 M ).},

This observed magniﬁcation provides a rare opportunity for a direct empirical test of galaxy cluster lens models. Here we test 17 lens models, 13 of which were generated before the SN magniﬁcation was known, qualifying as pure “blind tests.” The models are collectively fairly accurate: 8 of the models deliver median magniﬁcations that are consistent with the measured μ to within 1σ. However, there is a subtle systematic bias: the signiﬁcant disagreements all involve models overpredicting the magniﬁcation. We evaluate possible causes for this mild bias, and ﬁnd no single physical or methodological explanation to account for it. We do ﬁnd that model accuracy can be improved to some extent with stringent quality cuts on multiply imaged systems, such as requiring that a large fraction have spectroscopic redshifts. In addition to testing model accuracies as we have done here, Type Ia SN magniﬁcations could also be used as inputs for future lens models of Abell 2744 and other clusters, providing valuable constraints in regions where traditional strong- and weak-lensing information is unavailable.},

	abstract = {The diversity of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) photometry is explored using a grid of 130 one-dimensional models. It is shown that the observable properties of SNe Ia resulting from Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are chieﬂy determined by their ﬁnal composition and some measure of ‘‘mixing’’ in the explosion. A grid of ﬁnal compositions is explored, including essentially all combinations of 56Ni, stable ‘‘iron,’’ and intermediate-mass elements that result in an unbound white dwarf. Light curves (and in some cases spectra) are calculated for each model using two different approaches to the radiation transport problem. Within the resulting templates are models that provide good photometric matches to essentially the entire range of observed SNe Ia. On the whole, the grid of models spans a wide range in B-band peak magnitudes and decline rates, and does not obey a Phillips relation. In particular, models with the same mass of 56Ni show large variations in their light-curve decline rates. We identify and quantify the additional physical parameters responsible for this dispersion and consider physically motivated ‘‘cuts’’ of the models that agree better with the Phillips relation, discussing why nature may have preferred these solutions. For example, models that produce a constant total mass of burned material of 1:1 Æ 0:1 M  do give a crude Phillips relation, albeit with much scatter. If one further severely mixes the ejecta strongly between the center and 0.8 M  (as might be the case in a delayed-detonation scenario) reasonable agreement with the Phillips relation results, although still with considerable spread. We conclude that the supernova models that occur most frequently in nature are highly constrained by the Phillips relation and that a large part of the currently observed scatter in the relation is likely a consequence of the intrinsic diversity of these objects.},

High-redshift surveys continue apace, with a handful of Type Ia supernovae observed to date at redshifts of 1 or greater. In addition, a satellite has been proposed (the Supernova/Acceleration Probe [SNAP]) that will be dedicated to observing thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply imaged supernova from ongoing surveys, we ﬁnd that SNAP would observe at least eight such events per year. Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, SNAP’s large sample of Type II supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image separations, and relative image magniﬁcations, and the SNAP strong-lensing database will offer measures of Qm, QL, and H0, independent of SNAP’s primary goal of establishing the distance-redshift relation. These systems also constrain models for the matter density proﬁles of galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, lensed Type Ia supernovae afford us the opportunity to break the mass-sheet degeneracy found in many lensing measurements.},

Our results are based on almost daily observations for seven months at the ESO MPIA 2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. In addition, we re-analyze existing light curves from the literature that we complete with an additional three seasons of monitoring with the Mercator telescope at La Palma Observatory. When exploring the possible source of bias we considered the so-called microlensing time delay, a potential source of systematic error so far never directly accounted for in previous time-delay publications. In 15 yr of data on PG 1115+080, we ﬁnd no strong evidence of microlensing time delay. Therefore not accounting for this eﬀect, our time-delay estimates on the individual data sets are in good agreement with each other and with the literature. Combining the data sets, we obtain the most precise time-delay estimates to date on PG 1115+080, with ∆t(AB) = 8.3−+11..56 days (18.7\% precision), ∆t(AC) = 9.9+−11..11 days (11.1\%) and ∆t(BC) = 18.8+−11..66 days (8.5\%).

We combine the relative time delay between the quasar images, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, the Keck stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, and wide-ﬁeld photometric and spectroscopic data of the ﬁeld to constrain two angular diameter distance relations. The combined analysis is performed by forward modelling the individual data sets through a Bayesian hierarchical framework, and it is kept blind until the very end to prevent experimenter bias. After unblinding, the inferred distances imply a Hubble constant H0 = 68.8+−55..41 km s−1 Mpc−1, assuming a ﬂat cold dark matter cosmology with uniform prior on m in [0.05, 0.5]. The precision of our cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 is comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads. Our analysis is based on a completely independent lensing code than our previous three H0LiCOW systems and the new measurement is fully consistent with those. We provide the analysis scripts paired with the publicly available software to facilitate independent analysis (footnote with link to www.h0licow.org). The consistency between blind measurements with independent codes provides an important sanity check on lens modelling systematics. By combining the likelihoods of the four systems under the same prior, we obtain H0 = 72.5+−22..13 km s−1 Mpc−1. This measurement is independent of the distance ladder and other cosmological probes.},

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the “time-delay distance” to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 ± 15 km s−1 for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens’ environment. Our analysis of the HST images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution proﬁle logarithmic slope γ and the external convergence κext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density proﬁle logarithmic slope to be γ = 2.08 ± 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 ﬁeld provides an estimate of the prior for κext: 0.10−+00..0085. This latter distribution dominates the ﬁnal uncertainty on H0. Fixing the cosmological parameters at Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and w = −1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we ﬁnd H0 = 70.6−+33..11 km s−1 Mpc−1. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over κext. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) ﬁve-year data set, we ﬁnd that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between Ωm and ΩΛ at w = −1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be −0.031 {\textless} Ωk {\textless} 0.009 (95\% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a ﬂat spatial geometry, we ﬁnd that, in combination with WMAP, H0 = 69.7−+45..90 km s−1 Mpc−1 and w = −0.94−+00..1179 (68\% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples.

We estimate masses of host galaxies of PS1 supernovae and detect an insigniﬁcant difference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037 ± 0.031 mag for host galaxies with high and low masses.

Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe.

The peak magnitude is corrected for extinction using an estimate determined from MLCS2k2 ﬁtting. The rise time is measured from the well-observed B-band light curve with the ﬁrst detection at least 1mag fainter than the peak magnitude, and the photospheric velocity is measured from the strong absorption feature of Si IIλ6355 at the time of peak brightness. We model the relationship among these three parameters using an expanding ﬁreball with two assumptions: (a) the optical emission is approximately that of a blackbody, and (b) the photospheric temperatures of all SNeIa are the same at the time of peak brightness. We compare the precision of the distance residuals inferred using this physically motivated model against those from the empirical Phillips relation and the MLCS2k2 method for 47 low-redshift SNeIa (0.005 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.04) and ﬁnd comparable scatter. However, SNeIa in our sample with higher velocities are inferred to be intrinsically fainter. Eliminating the high-velocity SNe and applying a more stringent extinction cut to obtain a “low-v golden sample” of 22 SNe, we obtain signiﬁcantly reduced scatter of 0.108±0.018mag in the new relation, better than those of the Phillips relation and the MLCS2k2 method. For 250 km s−1 of residual peculiar motions, we ﬁnd 68\% and 95\% upper limits on the intrinsic scatter of 0.07 and 0.10 mag, respectively.},

From the onset of free expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative transfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray transfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of the temperature structure. Line ﬂuorescence processes can also be treated directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer calculation, providing a direct link between multidimensional hydrodynamic explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques applied in SEDONA and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations. We ﬁnd that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for complicated multidimensional conﬁgurations. We also investigate the accuracy of a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely, the stationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.},

We ﬁnd that lensed images in regions of low convergence, shear and stellar density are standardizable, where the microlensing scatter is 0.15 mag, comparable to the intrinsic dispersion of a typical SN Ia. These standardizable conﬁgurations correspond to asymmetric lenses with an image located far outside the Einstein radius of the lens. Symmetric and small Einstein radius lenses ( 0.5 arcsec) are not standardizable. We apply our model to the recently discovered GLSN Ia iPTF16geu and ﬁnd that the large discrepancy between the observed ﬂux and the macromodel predictions from More et al. cannot be explained by microlensing alone. Using the mock GLSNe Ia catalogue of Goldstein et al., we predict that ∼22 per cent of GLSNe Ia discovered by Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be standardizable, with a median Einstein radius of 0.9 arcsec and a median time delay of 41 d. By breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy the full LSST GLSNe Ia sample will be able to detect systematics in H0 at the 0.5 per cent level.},

Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the glSNIa yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the effect of microlensing on the precision and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from LSST glSNeIa. Microlensing has a negligible effect on the LSST glSNIa yield, but it can be increased by a factor of ∼2 over previous predictions to 930 systems using a novel photometric identiﬁcation technique based on spectral template ﬁtting. Crucially, the microlensing of glSNeIa is achromatic until three restframe weeks after the explosion, making the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay indicators. By ﬁtting simulated ﬂux and color observations of microlensed glSNeIa with their underlying, unlensed spectral templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for LSST, which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color curve observations in the achromatic phase, while for light-curve observations it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties (4\%). About 70\% of LSST glSNIa images should be discovered during the achromatic phase, indicating that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for microlensing, the 1–2 day time delay on the recently discovered glSNIa iPTF16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.},

Thus, microlensing of lensed supernova will be both ubiquitous and observable.

	abstract = {In the era of synoptic surveys, the number of known gravitationally lensed quasars is set to increase by over an order of magnitude. These new discoveries will enable a move from single-quasar studies to investigations of statistical samples, presenting new opportunities to test theoretical models for the structure of quasar accretion disks and broad emission line regions (BELRs). As one crucial step in preparing for this inﬂux of new lensed systems, a large-scale exploration of microlensing convergence–shear parameter space is warranted, requiring the computation of O(105) high-resolution magniﬁcation maps. Based on properties of known lensed quasars, and expectations from accretion disk/BELR modeling, we identify regions of convergence–shear parameter space, map sizes, smooth matter fractions, and pixel resolutions that should be covered. We describe how the computationally time-consuming task of producing ∼290,000 magniﬁcation maps with sufﬁcient resolution (10,0002 pixel map−1) to probe scales from the inner edge of the accretion disk to the BELR can be achieved in ∼400 days on a 100 teraﬂop s−1 high-performance computing facility, where the processing performance is achieved with graphics processing units. We illustrate a use-case for the parameter survey by investigating the effects of varying the lens macro-model on accretion disk constraints in the lensed quasar Q2237+0305. We ﬁnd that although all constraints are consistent within their current error bars, models with more densely packed microlenses tend to predict shallower accretion disk radial temperature proﬁles. With a large parameter survey such as the one described here, such systematics on microlensing measurements could be fully explored.},

	abstract = {As synoptic all-sky surveys begin to discover new multiply lensed quasars, the ﬂow of data will enable statistical cosmological microlensing studies of sufﬁcient size to constrain quasar accretion disk and supermassive black hole properties. In preparation for this new era, we are undertaking the GPU-Enabled, High Resolution cosmological MicroLensing parameter survey (GERLUMPH). We present here the GERLUMPH Data Release 1, which consists of 12,342 high resolution cosmological microlensing magniﬁcation maps and provides the ﬁrst uniform coverage of the convergence, shear, and smooth matter fraction parameter space. We use these maps to perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the mass-sheet degeneracy, ﬁnding excellent agreement with its predictions. We study the effect of smooth matter on microlensing induced magniﬁcation ﬂuctuations. In particular, in the minima and saddlepoint regions, ﬂuctuations are enhanced only along the critical line, while in the maxima region they are always enhanced for high smooth matter fractions (≈0.9). We describe our approach to data management, including the use of an SQL database with a Web interface for data access and online analysis, obviating the need for individuals to download large volumes of data. In combination with existing observational databases and online applications, the GERLUMPH archive represents a fundamental component of a new microlensing eResearch cloud. Our maps and tools are publicly available at http://gerlumph.swin.edu.au/.},

	abstract = {In the upcoming synoptic all-sky survey era of astronomy, thousands of new multiply imaged quasars are expected to be discovered and monitored regularly. Light curves from the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are further affected by superimposed variability due to microlensing. In order to disentangle the microlensing from the intrinsic variability of the light curves, the time delays between the multiple images have to be accurately measured. The resulting microlensing light curves can then be analyzed to reveal information about the background source, such as the size of the quasar accretion disk. In this paper we present the most extensive and coherent collection of simulated microlensing light curves; we have generated {\textgreater}2.5 billion light curves using the GERLUMPH high resolution microlensing magniﬁcation maps. Our simulations can be used to train algorithms to measure lensed quasar time delays, plan future monitoring campaigns, and study light curve properties throughout parameter space.

Correcting the absolute magnitudes for the measured decline rates yields in nearly all cases a dispersion consistent with measurement uncertainties, showing from these data that Type Ia supernovre are remarkably reliable standardized candles. With 26 supernovce between 0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1 and a cosmological sample of six supernovre between 0.35 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.45, the Cepheid-based Type Ia supernova absolute magnitude scale leads to a Hubble constant H0 = 60 ± 5 km s-1 Mpc-1 and a deceleration constant q 0 of 0.385 ± 0.36. We note the implications of these results for the age of the universe both with and ' without the introduction of a cosmological constant. This leads to further constraints on the mass density nM of the universe when comparison is made with the age of the universe derived from globular clusters.},

	abstract = {The time-delay between the arrival of photons of multiple images of time-variable sources can be used to constrain absolute distances in the Universe, and in turn obtain a direct estimate of the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters. To convert the time-delay into distances, it is well known that the gravitational potential of the main deﬂector and the contribution of the matter along the line of sight need to be known to a sufﬁcient level of precision. In this paper, we discuss a new astrometric requirement that is becoming important, as time-delay cosmography improves in precision and accuracy with larger samples, and better data and modelling techniques. We derive an analytic expression for the propagation of astrometric uncertainties on the multiple image positions into the inference of the Hubble constant and derive requirements depending on image separation and relative time-delay. We note that this requirement applies equally to the image position measurements and to the accuracy of the model in reproducing them. To illustrate the requirement, we discuss some example lensing conﬁgurations and highlight that, especially for time-delays of order 10 d or shorter, the relative astrometric requirement is of order milliarcseconds, setting a tight requirement on both measurements and models. With current optical infrared technology, astrometric uncertainties may be the dominant limitation for strong lensing cosmography in the small image-separation regime when high-precision time-delays become accessible.},

From the emission lines observed in their optical spectra, we derived the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the region where each SN Ia exploded. Our data show a trend, with an 80\% of chance not being due to random ﬂuctuation, between SNeIa absolute magnitudes and the oxygen abundances of the host galaxies, in the sense that luminosities tend to be higher for galaxies with lower metallicities. This result seems likely to be in agreement with both the theoretically expected behavior and with other observational results. This dependence MB–Z might induce systematic errors when it is not considered when deriving SNeIa luminosities and then using them to derive cosmological distances.},

We demonstrate that our previous result suggesting a metallicity dependence on the SN Ia luminosity for non-reddened SNe Ia can be extended to our whole sample.

	abstract = {Methods. The Nearby Supernova Factory has obtained ﬂux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia using integral ﬁeld spectroscopy. These observations enabled the simultaneous measurement of the SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measured or set limits on Hα emission, used as a tracer of ongoing star formation, within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This constitutes the ﬁrst direct study of the local environment for a large sample of SNe Ia with accurate luminosity, color, and stretch measurements.
Results. Our local star formation measurements provide several critical new insights. We ﬁnd that SNe Ia with local Hα emission are redder by 0.036 ± 0.017 mag, and that the previously noted correlation between stretch and host mass is driven entirely by the SNe Ia coming from locally passive environments, in particular at the low-stretch end. There is no such trend for SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments. Our most important ﬁnding is that the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local Hα emission is 0.094 ± 0.031 mag fainter on average than for those without. This oﬀset arises from a bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, with one mode being shared by SNe Ia in all environments and the other one exclusive to SNe Ia in locally passive environments. This structure also explains the previously known host-mass bias. We combine the star formation dependence of this bimodality with the cosmic star formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia brightness and the host-mass bias. The strong change predicted is conﬁrmed using high-redshift SNe Ia from the literature.
Conclusions. The environmental dependences in SN Ia Hubble residuals and color found here point to remaining systematic errors in the standardization of SNe Ia. In particular, the observed brightness oﬀset associated with local Hα emission is predicted to cause a signiﬁcant bias in current measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Recognition of these eﬀects oﬀers new opportunities to improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes. For instance, we note that the SNe Ia associated with local Hα emission are more homogeneous, resulting in a brightness dispersion of only 0.105 ± 0.012 mag.},

With these data we ﬁnd new evidence for a correlation between SN Ia intrinsic color and host metallicity. When we combine our data with those of other published SN Ia surveys, we ﬁnd the difference between mean SN Ia brightnesses in low- and high-mass hosts is 0.077 ± 0.014 mag. When viewed in narrow (0.2 dex) bins of host stellar mass, the data reveal apparent plateaus of Hubble residuals at high and low host masses with a rapid transition over a short mass range (9.8 log(M∗/M ) 10.4). Although metallicity has been a favored interpretation for the origin of the Hubble residual trend with host mass, we illustrate how dust in star-forming galaxies and mean SN Ia progenitor age both evolve along the galaxy mass sequence, thereby presenting equally viable explanations for some or all of the observed SN Ia host bias.},

We re-discover, to high signiﬁcance, the strong correlation between host galaxy type and the width of the observed SN light curve, i.e., fainter, quickly declining SNe Ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly declining Ia’s favor star-forming galaxies. We also ﬁnd evidence (at between 2σ and 3σ ) that SNe Ia are 0.1 ± 0.04 mag brighter in passive host galaxies than in star-forming hosts, after the SN Ia light curves have been standardized using the light-curve shape and color variations. This difference in brightness is present in both the SALT2 and MCLS2k2 light-curve ﬁtting methodologies. We see evidence for differences in the SN Ia color relationship between passive and star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the MLCS2k2 technique, we see that SNe Ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of RV = 1.0 ± 0.2, while SNe Ia in star-forming hosts require RV = 1.8−+00..24. The signiﬁcance of these trends depends on the range of SN colors considered. We demonstrate that these effects can be parameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a conﬁdence of {\textgreater}4σ ) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical ﬁt to our data.

We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the speciﬁc SFR of the parent galaxies—more vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later type galaxies seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple ‘‘two-component’’ model approximating the SN Ia rate, we ﬁnd bivariate linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of the host systems. We ﬁnd that the SN Ia rate can be well represented as the sum of 5:3 Æ 1:1 ; 10À14 SNe yrÀ1 M À1 and 3:9 Æ 0:7 ; 10À4 SNe yrÀ1 (M  yrÀ1)À1 of star formation. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally. Passive galaxies, with no star formation, preferentially host faster declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while brighter events are found in systems with ongoing star formation.},

	abstract = {The design and analysis of time-domain sky surveys requires the ability to simulate accurately realistic populations of core collapse supernova (SN) events. We present a set of spectral time-series templates designed for this purpose, for both hydrogen-rich (type II, IIn, IIb) and stripped envelope (types Ib, Ic, Ic-BL) core collapse supernovae. We use photometric and spectroscopic data for 67 core collapse supernovae from the literature, and for each generate a time-series spectral template. The techniques used to build the templates are fully data-driven with no assumption of any parametric form or model for the light curves. The template-building code is open-source, and can be applied to any transient for which well-sampled multi-band photometry and multiple spectroscopic observations are available. We extend these spectral templates into the near-ultraviolet to \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}sim 1600 {\textbackslash}AA\$ using observer-frame ultraviolet photometry. We also provide a set of templates corrected for host galaxy dust extinction, and provide a set of luminosity functions that can be used with our spectral templates in simulations. We give an example of how these templates can be used by integrating them within the popular SN simulation package \${\textbackslash}textsc\{snana\}\$, and simulating core collapse supernovae in photometrically-selected cosmological type Ia supernova samples, prone to contamination from core collapse events.},

Since we draw from many sources, we signiﬁcantly improve the spectra by inspecting these data for quality, removing galactic emission lines and cosmic rays, generating variance spectra, and correcting for the reddening caused by both MW and host-galaxy dust. With our data base, we organize this homogenized data set by 56 unique categories of SN-speciﬁc and spectrum-speciﬁc metadata. With KAEPORA, we produce composite spectra of subpopulations of SNe Ia and examine how spectral features correlate with various SN properties. These composite spectra reproduce known correlations with phase, light-curve shape, and host-galaxy morphology. With our large data set, we are also able to generate ﬁne-grained composite spectra simultaneously over both phase and light-curve shape. The colour evolution of our composite spectra is consistent with other SN Ia template spectra, and the spectral properties of our composite spectra are in rough agreement with these template spectra with some subtle differences. We investigate the spectral differences of SNe Ia that occur in galaxies with varying morphologies. Controlling for light-curve shape, which is highly correlated with host-galaxy morphology, we ﬁnd that SNe Ia residing in late-type and early-type galaxies have similar spectral properties at multiple epochs. However for SNe Ia in these different environments, their spectra appear to have Ca II near-infrared triplet features that have slightly different strengths. Although this is apparent in the composite spectra and there is some difference in the populations as seen by individual spectra, this difference is not large enough to indicate differences in the underlying populations. All individual spectra and metadata are available in our open-source data base KAEPORA along with the tools developed for this investigation to facilitate future investigations of SN Ia properties.},

	abstract = {Recently, there have been two landmark discoveries of gravitationally lensed supernovae: the ﬁrst multiply imaged SN, “Refsdal”, and the ﬁrst Type Ia SN resolved into multiple images, SN iPTF16geu. Fitting the multiple light curves of such objects can deliver measurements of the lensing time delays, which are the difference in arrival times for the separate images. These measurements provide precise tests of lens models or constraints on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters that are independent of the local distance ladder. Over the next decade, accurate time delay measurements will be needed for the tens to hundreds of lensed SNe to be found by wide-ﬁeld time-domain surveys such as LSST and WFIRST. We have developed an open-source software package for simulations and time delay measurements of multiply imaged SNe, including an improved characterization of the uncertainty caused by microlensing. Using this package, we describe simulations that suggest that a beforepeak detection of the leading image enables a more accurate and precise time delay measurement (by ∼1 and ∼2 days, respectively), when compared to an after-peak detection. We also conclude that ﬁtting the effects of microlensing without an accurate prior often leads to biases in the time delay measurement and over-ﬁtting to the data, but that employing a Gaussian Process Regression technique is sufﬁcient for determining the uncertainty due to microlensing.},

To improve the calibration, we present the application of spectral energy distribution-dependent ‘chromatic corrections’ to the SN light-curve photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). These corrections depend on the combined atmospheric and instrumental transmission function for each exposure, and they affect photometry at the 0.01 mag (1 per cent) level, comparable to systematic uncertainties in calibration and photometry. Fitting our combined DES and lowz SN Ia sample with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors for the cosmological parameters m (the fraction of the critical density of the universe comprised of matter) and w (the dark energy equation of state parameter), we compare those parameters before and after applying the corrections. We ﬁnd the change in w and m due to not including chromatic corrections is −0.002 and 0.000, respectively, for the DES-SN3YR sample with BAO and CMB priors, consistent with a larger DES-SN3YR-like simulation, which has a w-change of 0.0005 with an uncertainty of 0.008 and an m change of 0.000 with an uncertainty of 0.002.

While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broadband colors, it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame ﬁlters are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame ﬁlters are misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series that incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broadband colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features. Finally, we present a template spectroscopic sequence near maximum light for further improvement on the K-correction estimate. A library of \$600 observed spectra of \$100 SNe Ia from heterogeneous sources is used for the analysis.},

We ﬁnd that the maximum-light velocity of Si ii λ6355 and Ca ii H\&K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si ii λ6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si ii λ6355 measurements. Ca ii H\&K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer. Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference. The intrinsic color scatter is larger for higher-velocity SNe Ia—even after removing a linear trend with velocity—indicating that lower-velocity SNe Ia are more “standard crayons.” Employing information derived from SN Ia spectra has the potential to improve the measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological properties inferred from them.},

The main focus is on the relationships of SN Ia properties with stellar velocity dispersion and the stellar population parameters age, metallicity and element abundance ratios. We concentrate on a sub-sample of 84 SNe Ia from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey and ﬁnd that SALT2 stretch factor values show the strongest dependence on stellar population age. Hence, more luminous SNe Ia appear in younger stellar progenitor systems. No statistically signiﬁcant trends in the Hubble residual with any of the stellar population parameters studied are found. Moreover, the method of photometric stellar mass derivation affects the Hubble residual–mass relationship. For an extended sample (247 objects), including SNe Ia with SDSS host galaxy photometry only, the Hubble residual–mass relationship behaves as a sloped step function. In the high-mass regime, probed by our host spectroscopy sample, this relationship is ﬂat. Below a stellar mass of ∼2 × 1010 M , i.e. close to the evolutionary transition mass of low-redshift galaxies, the trend changes dramatically such that lower mass galaxies possess lower luminosity SNe Ia after light-curve corrections. The sloped step function of the Hubble residual–mass relationship should be accounted for when using stellar mass as a further parameter for minimizing the Hubble residuals.},

	abstract = {The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was the highest-ranked large space-based mission of the 2010 New Worlds, New Horizons decadal survey. It is now a NASA mission in formulation with a planned launch in the mid 2020s. A primary mission objective is to precisely constrain the nature of dark energy through multiple probes, including Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). Here, we present the ﬁrst realistic simulations of the WFIRST SN survey based on current hardware speciﬁcations and using open-source tools. We simulate SN light curves and spectra as viewed by the WFIRST wide-ﬁeld channel (WFC) imager and integral ﬁeld channel (IFC) spectrometer, respectively. We examine 11 survey strategies with different time allocations between the WFC and IFC, two of which are based upon the strategy described by the WFIRST Science Deﬁnition Team, which measures SN distances exclusively from IFC data. We propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties to predict the Dark Energy Task Force ﬁgure of merit (FoM) for each strategy. Of the strategies investigated, we ﬁnd the most successful to be WFC focused. However, further work in constraining systematics is required to fully optimize the use of the IFC. Even without improvements to other cosmological probes, the WFIRST SN survey has the potential to increase the FoM by more than an order of magnitude from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented here have not been fully optimized, these initial investigations are an important step in the development of the ﬁnal hardware design and implementation of the WFIRST mission.},

	abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a high étendue imaging facility that is being constructed atop Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. It is scheduled to begin science operations in 2022. With an ( effective) aperture, a novel three-mirror design achieving a seeing-limited field of view, and a 3.2 gigapixel camera, the LSST has the deep-wide-fast imaging capability necessary to carry out an survey in six passbands (ugrizy) to a coadded depth of over 10 years using of its observational time. The remaining of the time will be devoted to considerably deeper and faster time-domain observations and smaller surveys. In total, each patch of the sky in the main survey will receive 800 visits allocated across the six passbands with exposure visits. The huge volume of high-quality LSST data will provide a wide range of science opportunities and, in particular, open a new era of precision cosmology with unprecedented statistical power and tight control of systematic errors. In this review, we give a brief account of the LSST cosmology program with an emphasis on dark energy investigations. The LSST will address dark energy physics and cosmology in general by exploiting diverse precision probes including large-scale structure, weak lensing, type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, and strong lensing. Combined with the cosmic microwave background data, these probes form interlocking tests on the cosmological model and the nature of dark energy in the presence of various systematics. The LSST data products will be made available to the US and Chilean scientific communities and to international partners with no proprietary period. Close collaborations with contemporaneous imaging and spectroscopy surveys observing at a variety of wavelengths, resolutions, depths, and timescales will be a vital part of the LSST science program, which will not only enhance specific studies but, more importantly, also allow a more complete understanding of the Universe through different windows.},

	abstract = {We use simulated type Ia supernova (SN Ia) samples, including both photometry and spectra, to perform the ﬁrst direct validation of cosmology analysis using the SALT-II light curve model. This validation includes residuals from the light curve training process, systematic biases in SN Ia distance measurements, and a bias on the dark energy equation of state parameter w. Using the SN-analysis package SNANA, we simulate and analyze realistic samples corresponding to the data samples used in the SNLS3 analysis: ∼120 low-redshift (z {\textless} 0.1) SNe Ia, ∼255 Sloan Digital Sky Survey SNe Ia (z {\textless} 0.4), and ∼290 SNLS SNe Ia (z 1). To probe systematic uncertainties in detail, we vary the input spectral model, the model of intrinsic scatter, and the smoothing (i.e., regularization) parameters used during the SALT-II model training. Using realistic intrinsic scatter models results in a slight bias in the ultraviolet portion of the trained SALT-II model, and w biases (winput − wrecovered) ranging from −0.005 ± 0.012 to −0.024 ± 0.010. These biases are indistinguishable from each other within the uncertainty; the average bias on w is −0.014 ± 0.007.},
