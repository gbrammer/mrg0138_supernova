	abstract = {The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) mission is expected to launch in the mid-2020s. Its weak lensing program is designed to enable unprecedented systematics control in photometric measurements, including shear recovery, point spread function (PSF) correction, and photometric calibration. This will enable exquisite weak lensing science and allow us to adjust to and reliably contribute to the cosmological landscape after the initial years of observations from other concurrent Stage IV dark energy experiments. This potential requires equally careful planning and requirements validation as the mission prepares to enter its construction phase. We present a suite of image simulations based on galsim that are used to construct a complex, synthetic Roman weak lensing survey that incorporates realistic input galaxies and stars, relevant detector non-idealities, and the current reference 5-yr Roman survey strategy. We present a first study to empirically validate the existing Roman weak lensing requirements flowdown using a suite of 12 matched image simulations, each representing a different perturbation to the wavefront or image motion model. These are chosen to induce a range of potential static and low- and high-frequency time-dependent PSF model errors. We analyse the measured shapes of galaxies from each of these simulations and compare them to a reference, fiducial simulation to infer the response of the shape measurement to each of these modes in the wavefront model. We then compare this to existing analytic flowdown requirements, and find general agreement between the empirically derived response and that predicted by the analytic model.},

	abstract = {Context. Massive galaxy clusters at intermediate redshifts act as 
gravitational lenses that can magnify supernovae (SNe) occurring in
background galaxies. Aims: We assess the possibility of using
lensed SNe to constraint the mass models of galaxy clusters and the
Hubble parameter at high redshift. Methods: Owing to the standard
candle nature of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), observational information
on the lensing magnification by an intervening galaxy cluster can be
used to constrain the model for the cluster mass distribution. A
statistical analysis using parametric cluster models was performed to
investigate the possible improvements provided by lensed SNe Ia to the
analysis of the accurately modeled galaxy cluster A1689 and the less
well-modeled cluster A2204. Time delay measurements obtained from SNe
lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to measure the
Hubble parameter. For a survey of A1689, we estimate the expected rates
of detectable SNe Ia and multiply imaged SNe. Results: The
velocity dispersion and core radius of the main cluster potential follow
strong correlations with the predicted magnifications and can therefore
be constrained by observations of SNe Ia in background galaxies. This
technique proves especially powerful for galaxy clusters with only a few
known multiple image systems. The main uncertainty in measurements of
the Hubble parameter from the time delay of strongly lensed SNe is
caused by cluster model uncertainties. For the extremely well-modeled
cluster A1689, a single time delay measurement could be used to
determine the Hubble parameter with a precision of {\textasciitilde}10\%. 
Conclusions: Observations of SNe Ia behind galaxy clusters can be used
to improve the mass modeling of the large-scale component of galaxy
clusters and thus the distribution of dark matter. Time delays from SNe
strongly lensed by accurately modeled galaxy clusters can be used to
measure the Hubble constant at high redshifts.

	abstract = {(Abridged) Several phenomena in astrophysics generate light curves with 
time delays. Among these are reverberation mapping, and lensed quasars.
In some systems, the measurement of the time-delay is complicated by the
fact that the delayed components are unresolved and that the light
curves are generated from a red-noise process. We derive the likelihood
function of the observations given a model of either a combination of
time-delayed light curves or a single light curve. This likelihood
function is different from the auto-correlation function. We demonstrate
that given a single-band light curve that is a combination of two (or
more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve, generated from a
red-noise probability distribution, we can test if the total-flux light
curve is a composition of time-delayed copies or, alternatively, is
consistent with being the original light curve. Furthermorew, in some
realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and flux
ratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is
about 1/10. This method is useful for identifying lensed quasars and
simultaneously measuring their time delays, and for estimating the
reverberation time scales of active galactic nuclei. In a companion
paper, we derive a method that uses the center-of-light position (e.g.,
of a lensed quasar) along with the combined flux. This allow us to
identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their time delays,
with higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method. The astrometry +
flux method, however, is not suitable for quasar reverberation mapping.
We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting a power-law model
to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such
a fit. We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and
MATLAB implementations.},

	abstract = {Lensed quasars and supernovae can be used to study galaxies' 
gravitational potential and measure cosmological parameters. The typical
image separation of objects lensed by galaxies is of the order of 0.5".
Therefore, finding the ones with small separations, and measuring their
time-delays using ground-based observations is challenging. We suggest a
new method to identify lensed quasars and simultaneously measure their
time-delays, using seeing-limited synoptic observations in which the
lensed quasar images and the lensing galaxy are unresolved. We show that
using the light curve of the combined flux, and the astrometric
measurements of the center-of-light position of the lensed images, the
lensed nature of a quasar can be identified, and its time-delay can be
measured. We provide the analytic formalism to do so, taking into
account the measurement errors and the fact that the power spectra of
quasar light curves is red (i.e., the light curve is highly correlated).
We demonstrate our method on simulated data, while its implementation to
real data will be presented in future papers. Our simulations suggest
that, under reasonable assumptions, the new method can detect unresolved
lensed quasars and measure their time delays, even when the image
separation is below 0.1", or the flux ratio between the faintest and
brightest images is as low as 0.03. Python and MATLAB implementations
are provided. In a companion paper, we present a method for measuring
the time delay using the combined flux observations. Although the
flux-only method is less powerful, it may be useful in cases in which
the astrometric information is not relevant (e.g., reverberation
mapping).},

expands on previous microlensing studies of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).
We use the radiative-transfer code \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}small TARDIS\}\$ to recreate
five spectra of the prototypical SN 1999em at different times within the
plateau phase of the light curve. The microlensing-induced deformations
of the spectra and light curves are calculated by placing the SN into
magnification maps generated with the code \$\{{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}small GERLUMPH\}\$. We
study the impact of microlensing on the color curves and find that there
is no strong influence on them during the investigated time interval of
the plateau phase. The color curves are only weakly affected by
microlensing due to the almost achromatic behavior of the intensity
profiles. However, the lack of non-linear structure in the color curves
makes time-delay measurements difficult given the possible presence of
differential dust extinction. Therefore, we further investigate SN phase
inference through spectral absorption lines under the influence of
microlensing and Gaussian noise. As the spectral features shift to
longer wavelengths with progressing time after explosion, the measured
wavelength of a specific absorption line provides information on the
epoch of the SN. The comparison between retrieved epochs of two observed
lensing images then gives the time delay of the images. We find that the
phase retrieval method using spectral features yields accurate delays

This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, \${\textbackslash}Delta t = 1.4 {\textbackslash}pm 5.0\$ days, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the
light-curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at z=0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z=0.2163. We detect strong Na ID absorption in the host galaxy,
indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying "anomalously" large Na ID column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, \${\textbackslash}sigma = 129 {\textbackslash}pm 4\$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model. Since the time-delay between the SN images is negligible, we can use
unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor {\textasciitilde}70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si II-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal SN Ia, indistinguishable from
well-studied ones in the local universe, providing support for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.},

simulate three clusters of galaxies, each composed of a cluster-scale
halo and a set of perturbing galaxy-scale subhalos. We ray-trace three
light beams through each model to produce a catalogue of multiple
images, and then use the MCMC sampler to recover the model parameters in
the three different lensing configurations. We find that, for typical
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-quality imaging data, the total mass in the
Einstein radius is recovered with {\textasciitilde}1-5\% error according to the
considered lensing configuration. However, we find that the mass of the
galaxies is strongly degenerated with the cluster mass when no multiple
images appear in the cluster centre. The mass of the galaxies is
generally recovered with a 20\% error, largely due to the poorly
constrained cut-off radius. Finally, we describe how to rank models
quantitatively using the Bayesian evidence. We confirm the ability of
strong lensing to constrain the mass profile in the central region of
galaxy clusters in this way. Ultimately, such a method applied to strong

To convert the time-delay into distances, it is well known that the gravitational potential of the main deflector and the contribution of the matter along the line of sight need to be known to a sufficient level of precision. In this paper, we discuss a new astrometric requirement that is becoming important, as time-delay cosmography improves in precision and accuracy with larger samples, and better data and modelling techniques. We derive an analytic expression for the propagation of astrometric uncertainties on the multiple image positions into the inference of the Hubble constant and derive requirements depending on image separation and relative
time-delay. We note that this requirement applies equally to the image position measurements and to the accuracy of the model in reproducing them. To illustrate the requirement, we discuss some example lensing configurations and highlight that, especially for time-delays of order 10 d or shorter, the relative astrometric requirement is of order milliarcseconds, setting a tight requirement on both measurements and models. With current optical infrared technology, astrometric
uncertainties may be the dominant limitation for strong lensing
cosmography in the small image-separation regime when high-precision time-delays become accessible.},

lensed galaxies with 47 multiple images behind Abell 370. This is
consistent with the expectation of 0.09 ± 0.02 SNe calculated
based on the measured star formation rate. We compare the expectations
of discovering strongly lensed SNe in our survey and that performed with
HST during the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) programme. We also show the
expectations of search campaigns that can be conducted with future
facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). We show that the NIRCam
instrument aboard the JWST will be sensitive to most SN multiple images
in the strongly lensed galaxies and thus will be able to measure their
time delays if observations are scheduled accordingly.

as a novel and independent tool for estimating the Hubble constant ( H
0). This is very important given the recent discord in the
value of H 0) from two methods that probe different distance
ranges. The success of this technique will rely of our ability to
discover strongly lensed SNe with measurable time delays. Here, we
present the magnifications and the time delays for the multiply-imaged
galaxies behind the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy clusters, by
using recently published lensing models. Continuing on our previous work
done for Abell 1689 (A1689) and Abell 370, we also show the prospects of
observing strongly lensed SNe behind the HFF clusters with the upcoming
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With four 1-hour visits in one year,
the summed expectations of all six HFF clusters are 0.5 core-collapse
(CC) SNe and 0.06 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in F115W band, while with F150W
the expectations are higher, 0.9 CC SNe and 0.06 SNe Ia. These
estimates match those expected by only surveying A1689, proving that the
performance of A1689 as gravitational telescope is superior. In the five
HFF clusters presented here, we find that F150W will be able to detect
SNe Ia (SNe IIP) exploding in 93 (80) pairsmultiply-imaged galaxies with
time delays of less than 5 years.},

to investigate the nature of dark energy with a variety of methods.
Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) will be one of the principal
anchors of the Roman cosmology program, through traditional luminosity
distance measurements. This SNIa cosmology program can provide another
valuable cosmological probe, without altering the mission strategy: time
delay cosmography with gravitationally lensed SN. In this work, we
forecast lensed SN cosmology constraints with the Roman Space Telescope,
while providing useful tools for future work. Using anticipated
characteristics of the Roman SNIa survey, we have constructed mock
catalogs of expected resolved lensing systems, as well as strongly
lensed Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SN light curves, including
microlensing effects. We predict Roman will find {\textasciitilde}11 lensed SNIa and {\textasciitilde}20
CCSN, dependent on the survey strategy. Next, we estimate the time delay
precision obtainable with Roman (Ia: {\textasciitilde}2 days, CC: {\textasciitilde}3 days), and use a
Fisher matrix analysis to derive projected constraints on
\$H\_0\$,\${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, and the dark energy Equation of State (EOS), \$w\$, for
each SNIa survey strategy. A strategy optimized for high-redshift SNIa
discovery is preferred when considering the constraints possible from
both SNIa and lensed SN cosmology, also delivering {\textasciitilde}1.5 times more
lensed SN than other proposed survey strategies.},

The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them.

This confusion between terms and problems causes the repetition of research and hinders the advance of the field. Therefore, a standardization is imperative. The goal of this paper is to underline the differences between each term, and organize the area by looking at all these terms under the umbrella of supervised classification. Therefore, a one-to-one assignment of terms to learning scenarios is proposed. In fact, each learning scenario is associated with the term most frequently used in the literature.

While most current deep learning papers contain such visualizations, these are usually handcrafted just before publication, which results in a lack of a common visual grammar, significant time investment, errors, and ambiguities. Current automatic network visualization tools focus on debugging the network itself and are not ideal for generating publication visualizations. Therefore, we present an approach to automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras into visualizations that can directly be embedded into any publication. To do so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and CVPR papers published between 2013 and 2019. The proposed grammar incorporates visual encoding, network layout, layer aggregation, and legend generation. We have further realized our approach in an online system available to the community, which we have evaluated through expert feedback, and a quantitative study. It not only reduces the time needed to generate network visualizations for publications, but also enables a unified and unambiguous visualization design.},

	abstract = {Large-scale imaging surveys will increase the number of galaxy-scale strong lensing candidates by maybe three orders of magnitudes beyond the number known today. Finding these rare objects will require picking them out of at least tens of millions of images, and deriving scientific results from them will require quantifying the efficiency and bias of any search method. To achieve these objectives automated methods must be developed. Because gravitational lenses are rare objects, reducing false positives will be particularly important. We present a description and results of an open gravitational lens finding challenge. Participants were asked to classify 100 000 candidate objects as to whether they were gravitational lenses or not with the goal of developing better automated methods for finding lenses in large data sets. A variety of methods were used including visual inspection, arc and ring finders, support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We find that many of the methods will be easily fast enough to analyse the anticipated data flow. In test data, several methods are able to identify upwards of half the lenses after applying some thresholds on the lens characteristics such as lensed image brightness, size or contrast with the lens galaxy without making a single false-positive identification. This is significantly better than direct inspection by humans was able to do. Having multi-band, ground based data is found to be better for this purpose than single-band space based data with lower noise and higher resolution, suggesting that multi-colour data is crucial. Multi-band space based data will be superior to ground based data. The most difficult challenge for a lens finder is differentiating between rare, irregular and ring-like face-on galaxies and true gravitational lenses. The degree to which the efficiency and biases of lens finders can be quantified largely depends on the realism of the simulated data on which the finders are trained.},

	abstract = {The morphological classification of radio sources is important to gain a full understanding of galaxy evolution processes and their relation with local environmental properties. Furthermore, the complex nature of the problem, its appeal for citizen scientists and the large data rates generated by existing and upcoming radio telescopes combine to make the morphological classification of radio sources an ideal test case for the application of machine learning techniques. One approach that has shown great promise recently is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Literature, however, lacks two major things when it comes to CNNs and radio galaxy morphological classification. Firstly, a proper analysis of whether overfitting occurs when training CNNs to perform radio galaxy morphological classification using a small curated training set is needed. Secondly, a good comparative study regarding the practical applicability of the CNN architectures in literature is required. Both of these shortcomings are addressed in this paper. Multiple performance metrics are used for the latter comparative study, such as inference time, model complexity, computational complexity and mean per class accuracy. As part of this study we also investigate the effect that receptive field, stride length and coverage has on recognition
performance. For the sake of completeness, we also investigate the recognition performance gains that we can obtain by employing
classification ensembles. A ranking system based upon recognition and computational performance is proposed. MCRGNet, Radio Galaxy Zoo and ConvXpress (novel classifier) are the architectures that best balance computational requirements with recognition performance.},

	abstract = {We present an algorithm using principal component analysis (PCA) to subtract galaxies from imaging data and also two algorithms to find strong, galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in the resulting residual image. The combined method is optimised to find full or partial Einstein rings. Starting from a pre-selection of potential massive galaxies, we first perform a PCA to build a set of basis vectors. The galaxy images are reconstructed using the PCA basis and subtracted from the data. We then filter the residual image with two different methods. The first uses a curvelet (curved wavelets) filter of the residual images to enhance any curved/ring feature. The resulting image is transformed in polar coordinates, centred on the lens galaxy. In these coordinates, a ring is turned into a line, allowing us to detect very faint rings by taking advantage of the integrated signal-to-noise in the ring (a line in polar coordinates). The second way of analysing the PCA-subtracted images identifies structures in the residual images and assesses whether they are lensed images according to their orientation, multiplicity, and elongation. We applied the two methods to a sample of simulated Einstein rings as they would be observed with the ESA Euclid satellite in the VIS band. The polar coordinate transform allowed us to reach a completeness of 90\% for a purity of 86\%, as soon as the signal-to-noise integrated in the ring was higher than 30 and almost independent of the size of the Einstein ring. Finally, we show with real data that our PCA-based galaxy subtraction scheme performs better than traditional subtraction based on model fitting to the data. Our algorithm can be developed and improved further using machine learning and dictionary learning methods, which would extend the capabilities of the method to more complex and diverse galaxy shapes.},

strong lenses created by using state-of-the-art extragalactic catalogs,
we train a modular deep learning pipeline for uncertainty-quantified
detection and modeling with intermediate image processing components for
denoising and deblending the lensing systems. We demonstrate a higher
degree of interpretability and controlled systematics due to
domain-specific task modules that are trained with different stages of
synthetic image generation. For lens detection and modeling, we obtain
semantically meaningful latent spaces that separate classes and provide
uncertainty estimates that explain the misclassified images and provide
uncertainty bounds on the lens parameters. In addition, we obtain an
improved performance---lens detection (classification) improved from 82\%

improved by 25\% over the baseline model.},

The spindle is a normal S0 disk seen nearly edge-on; the ring motions suggest that a massive halo extends far beyond the S0 disk and is more spherical than flat. From a study of 22 related galaxies, it is found that a few percent of all field S0's possess near-polar rings or disks. It is suggested that these structures are due to a second event, most likely the transfer of mass from a companion galaxy during a close encounter and occasionally also the merger of a companion.},

(ii) Polar structures in our sample are, on average, fainter and bluer than their host galaxies. (iii) In most galaxies, the stellar mass M* of the polar component is not negligible in comparison with that of the host. (iv) The distributions of the host galaxies on the size -
luminosity and Kormendy diagrams are shifted by ∼1 mag to fainter magnitudes in comparison with E/S0 galaxies. It means that the PRGs hosts are more similar to quenched discs than to ordinary early-type galaxies. (v) All the PRGs in our sample are detected in mid-infrared by WISE, and we derive from the 22 μm luminosity their star formation rate (SFR). Their SFR/M* ratio is larger than for the early-type galaxy sample of Atlas3D, showing that the star-forming disc brings a significant contribution to the new stars.

Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to
simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the Sérsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and
Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential
applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei.

	abstract = {Galaxies with polar rings (PRGs) are a unique class of extragalactic 
objects. Using these, we can investigate a wide range of problems,
linked to the formation and evolution of galaxies, and we can study the
properties of their dark haloes. The progress that has been made in the
study of PRGs has been constrained by the small number of known objects
of this type. The Polar Ring Catalogue (PRC) by Whitmore et al. and
their photographic atlas of PRGs and related objects includes 157
galaxies. At present, there are only about two dozen kinematically
confirmed galaxies in this PRG class, mostly from the PRC.

We present a new catalogue of PRGs, supplementing the PRC and
significantly increasing the number of known candidate PRGs. The
catalogue is based on the results of the original Galaxy Zoo project.
Within this project, volunteers performed visual classifications of
nearly a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
Based on the preliminary classifications of the Galaxy Zoo, we viewed
more than 40 000 images of the SDSS and selected 275 galaxies to include
in our catalogue.

Our SDSS-based Polar Ring Catalogue (SPRC) contains 70 galaxies that we
have classified as 'the best candidates'. Among these, we expect to have
a very high proportion of true PRGs, and 115 good PRG candidates. There
are 53 galaxies classified as PRG-related objects (mostly galaxies with
strongly warped discs, and mergers). In addition, we have identified 37
galaxies that have their presumed polar rings strongly inclined to the
line of sight (seen almost face-on). The SPRC objects are, on average,
fainter and are located further away than the galaxies from the PRC,
although our catalogue does include dozens of new nearby candidate PRGs.

The SPRC significantly increases the number of genuine PRG candidates.
It might serve as a good basis for both a further detailed study of
individual galaxies and a statistical analysis of PRGs as a separate
class of objects.

We have performed spectroscopic observations of six galaxies from the
SPRC at the 6-m Big Telescope Alt-Azimuthal (BTA). The existence of
polar rings was confirmed in five galaxies, and one object appeared to
be a projection of a pair of galaxies. Adding the data from the
literature, we can already classify 10 galaxies from our catalogue as
kinematically confirmed PRGs. This paper is partly based on observations
collected with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical
Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which is operated under
the financial support of the Science Department of Russia (registration

accretion plays a major role. This idea is supported by our numerical

information in redshift estimation. Support vector machines, a type of
machine learning, utilize optimization theory and supervised learning
algorithms to construct predictive models based on the information
content of data in a way that can treat different input features
symmetrically, which can be a useful estimator of the information
contained in additional features beyond photometry, such as those
describing the morphology of galaxies. Methods: The custom
support vector machine package we have developed is designated SPIDERz
and made available to the community. As test data for evaluating
performance and comparison with other methods, we apply SPIDERz to four
distinct data sets: 1) the publicly available portion of the PHAT-1
catalog based on the GOODS-N field with spectroscopic redshifts in the
range z {\textless} 3.6, 2) 14 365 galaxies from the COSMOS bright survey with
photometric band magnitudes, morphology, and spectroscopic redshifts
inside z {\textless} 1.4, 3) 3048 galaxies from the overlap of COSMOS
photometry and morphology with 3D-HST spectroscopy extending to z {\textless}
3.9, and 4) 2612 galaxies with five-band photometric magnitudes and
morphology from the All-wavelength Extended Groth Strip International
Survey and z {\textless} 1.57. Results: We find that SPIDERz achieves
results competitive with other empirical packages on the PHAT-1 data,
and performs quite well in estimating redshifts with the COSMOS and
AEGIS data, including in the cases of a large redshift range (0 {\textless} z
{\textless} 3.9). We also determine from analyses with both the COSMOS and
AEGIS data that the inclusion of morphological information does not have
a statistically significant benefit for photometric redshift estimation

Two formation scenarios for these objects have been proposed: they are thought to form either in major galaxy mergers or by tidal accretion of the polar material from a gas rich donor galaxy. Both scenarios are studied through N-body simulations including gas dynamics and star formation. Constraints on physical parameters are drawn out, in order to determine which scenario is the most likely to occur. Polar ring galaxies from each scenario are compared with observations and we discuss whether the accretion scenario and the merging scenario account for observational properties of polar ring galaxies. The conclusion of this study is that the accretion scenario is both the most likely and the most supported by observations. Even if the merging scenario is rather robust, most polar ring galaxies are shown to be the result of tidal gas accretion events.

	abstract = {We present a new non-parametric method to quantify morphologies of 
galaxies based on a particular family of learning machines called
support vector machines. The method, that can be seen as a
generalization of the classical CAS classification but with an unlimited
number of dimensions and non-linear boundaries between decision regions,
is fully automated and thus particularly well adapted to large
cosmological surveys. The source code is available for download at
http://www.lesia.obspm.fr/∼huertas/galsvm.html. To test the method,
we use a seeing limited near-infrared (Ks band, 2,16μ m)
sample observed with WIRCam at CFHT at a median redshift of z∼0.8.
The machine is trained with a simulated sample built from a local
visually classified sample from the SDSS chosen in the high-redshift
sample's rest-frame (i band, 0.77μ m ) and artificially redshifted to
match the observing conditions. We use a 12-dimensional volume,
including 5 morphological parameters, and other caracteristics of
galaxies such as luminosity and redshift. A fraction of the simulated
sample is used to test the machine and assess its accuracy. We show that
a qualitative separation in two main morphological types (late type and
early type) can be obtained with an error lower than 20\% up to the
completeness limit of the sample (KAB∼ 22) which is more than 2
times better that what would be obtained with a classical C/A
classification on the same sample and indeed comparable to space data.
The method is optimized to solve a specific problem, offering an
objective and automated estimate of errors that enables a
straightforward comparison with other surveys. Selecting the training
sample in the high-redshift sample rest-frame makes the results free
from wavelength dependent effects and hence its interpretation in terms
of evolution easier.},

A spiral galaxy intruding from the polar axis of the other victim galaxy excites the outwardly propagating density wave in the gaseous component of the victim galaxy. The
subsequent gaseous dissipation and star formation dramatically transform the victim galaxy into polar rings. The intruding galaxy, on the other hand, is inevitably transformed into a rapidly rotating and spindly S0 galaxy, owing to the violent gravitational interaction of galaxy merging. This numerical result implies that dissipative galaxy merging between two gas-rich spirals is a new, promising candidate that can explain not only the formation of the central S0-like host but also the formation of a gas-rich polar ring component in a polar ring S0 galaxy.},

If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drops to 90\{\{ per cent\}\}, we find that DEEPSOURCE reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the 4.3 of PYBDSF (natural weighting). A key advantage of DEEPSOURCE is that it can learn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under consideration. Our results show that deep learning is a promising approach to point source detection in

	abstract = {We review the current state of data mining and machine learning in astronomy. Data Mining can have a somewhat mixed connotation from the point of view of a researcher in this field. If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach, holding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can be little more than the black box application of complex computing algorithms that may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here, we give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection through to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, applications from a broad range of astronomy,
emphasizing those in which data mining techniques directly contributed to improving science, and important current and future directions, including probability density functions, parallel algorithms, Peta-Scale computing, and the time domain. We conclude that, so long as one carefully selects an appropriate algorithm and is guided by the
astronomical problem at hand, data mining can be very much the powerful tool, and not the questionable black box.},

	abstract = {Astronomy is experiencing a rapid growth in data size and complexity. This change fosters the development of data-driven science as a useful companion to the common model-driven data analysis paradigm, where astronomers develop automatic tools to mine datasets and extract novel information from them. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers, and are now used for a wide variety of tasks. In light of these developments, and the promise and challenges associated with them, the IAC Winter School 2018 focused on big data in Astronomy, with a particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This document summarizes the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms presented during the school, and provides practical information on the application of such tools to astronomical datasets. In this document I cover basic topics in supervised machine learning, including selection and preprocessing of the input dataset, evaluation methods, and three popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and shallow Artificial Neural Networks. My main focus is on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, that are used to perform cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and outlier detection.
Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular importance to scientific research, since they can be used to extract new knowledge from existing datasets, and can facilitate new discoveries.},

to investigate the nature of dark energy with a variety of methods.
Observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) will be one of the principal

distance measurements. This SNIa cosmology program can provide another
valuable cosmological probe, without altering the mission strategy: time
delay cosmography with gravitationally lensed SN. In this work, we
forecast lensed SN cosmology constraints with the Roman Space Telescope,
while providing useful tools for future work. Using anticipated
characteristics of the Roman SNIa survey, we have constructed mock
catalogs of expected resolved lensing systems, as well as strongly
lensed Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) SN light curves, including
microlensing effects. We predict Roman will find {\textasciitilde}11 lensed SNIa and {\textasciitilde}20
CCSN, dependent on the survey strategy. Next, we estimate the time delay
precision obtainable with Roman (Ia: {\textasciitilde}2 days, CC: {\textasciitilde}3 days), and use a
Fisher matrix analysis to derive projected constraints on
\$H\_0\$,\${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$, and the dark energy Equation of State (EOS), \$w\$, for
each SNIa survey strategy. A strategy optimized for high-redshift SNIa

sample of known Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) from \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}3\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}5\$.
With this reduction of statistical uncertainties on cosmological
measurements, new methods are needed to reduce systematic uncertainties.
Characterizing the underlying spectroscopic evolution of SN Ia remains a
major systematic uncertainty in current cosmological analyses,
motivating a new simulation tool for the next era of SN Ia cosmology:
Build Your Own Spectral Energy Distribution (BYOSED). BYOSED is used
within the SNANA framework to simulate light curves by applying spectral
variations to model SEDs, enabling flexible testing of possible
systematic shifts in SN Ia distance measurements. We test the framework
by comparing a nominal Roman SN Ia survey simulation using a baseline
SED model to simulations using SEDs perturbed with BYOSED, and
investigate the impact of neglecting specific SED features in the
analysis. These features include semi-empirical models of two possible,
predicted relationships: between SN ejecta velocity and light curve
observables, and a redshift-dependent relationship between SN Hubble
residuals and host galaxy mass. We analyze each BYOSED simulation using
the SALT2 \& BBC framework, and estimate changes in the measured
value of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, \$w\$. We find a
difference of \${\textbackslash}Delta w=-0.023\$ for SN velocity and \${\textbackslash}Delta w=0.021\$ for
redshift-evolving host mass when compared to simulations without these
features. By using BYOSED for SN Ia cosmology simulations, future
analyses (e.g., Rubin and Roman SN Ia samples) will have greater
flexibility to constrain or reduce such SN Ia modeling uncertainties.},

1044 erg s-1. We show that the spectra of
this transient source are well fit by normal Type Ia supernova (SNIa) templates. The multi-band colors and light-curve shapes are also consistent with normal SNeIa at the spectroscopically determined redshift of z = 1.3883; however, the observed flux is a constant factor of {\textasciitilde}30 times too bright in each band over time as compared to the templates. At minimum, this shows that the peak luminosities inferred from the light-curve widths of some SNeIa will deviate significantly from the established, empirical relation used by cosmologists. We argue on physical grounds that the observed fluxes do not reflect an
intrinsically luminous SNIa, but rather PS1-10afx is a normal SNIa whose flux has been magnified by an external source. The only known
astrophysical source capable of such magnification is a gravitational lens. Given the lack of obvious lens candidates, such as galaxy
clusters, in the vicinity, we further argue that the lens is a
supermassive black hole or a comparatively low-mass dark matter halo. In this case, the lens continues to magnify the underlying host galaxy light. If confirmed, this discovery could impact a broad range of topics including cosmology, gamma-ray bursts, and dark matter halos.},

and accurate time-delay measurements, making lensed type-Ia supernovae a
new golden standard for time-delay cosmography. However, the 3D geometry
of the expanding shell can introduce an additional bias that has not yet
been fully explored. In this work, we present and discuss the impact of
this effect on time-delay cosmography with lensed supernovae and find
that on average it leads to a bias of a few tenths of a day for
individual lensed systems. This is negligible in view of the

the resolved images provides unique information about the differential
dimming due to dust in the lensing galaxy. Using HST and Keck AO

magnification for iPTF16geu of μ = 67.8{\textasciicircum}\{+2.6\}\_\{-2.9\}, accounting for
extinction in the host and lensing galaxy. As expected from the symmetry

suggesting similar image brightnesses. A possible explanation for the
large differences is gravitational lensing by substructures, micro- or

Here, refined observations of iPTF16geu, including the time delay between images, are used to decrease uncertainties in the lens model, including the the slope of the projected surface density of the lens galaxy, Σ
∝ r1 ‑ η, and to constrain the universal
expansion rate H0. Imaging with Hubble Space Telescope provides an upper limit on the slope η, in slight tension with the steeper density profiles indicated by imaging with Keck after iPTF16geu had faded, potentially due to dust extinction not corrected for in host galaxy imaging. Since smaller η implies larger magnifications, we take advantage of the standard candle nature of SNe Ia constraining the image magnifications, to obtain an independent constraint of the slope. We find that a smooth lens density fails to explain the iPTF16geu fluxes, regardless of the slope, and additional substructure lensing is needed. The total probability for the smooth halo model combined with star microlensing to explain the iPTF16geu image fluxes is maximized at 12 per cent for η ∼ 1.8, in excellent agreement with Keck
high-spatial-resolution data, and flatter than an isothermal halo. It also agrees perfectly with independent constraints on the slope from lens velocity dispersion measurements. Combining with the observed time delays between the images, we infer a lower bound on the Hubble

From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with HST, we can resolve spectra of individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, \${\textbackslash}Delta t = 1.4 {\textbackslash}pm 5.0\$ days, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the
light-curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at z=0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z=0.2163. We detect strong Na ID absorption in the host galaxy,
indicating that iPTF16geu belongs to a subclass of SNe Ia displaying "anomalously" large Na ID column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, \${\textbackslash}sigma = 129 {\textbackslash}pm 4\$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model. Since the time-delay between the SN images is negligible, we can use
unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor {\textasciitilde}70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z SN Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si II-line indicate that iPTF16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal SN Ia, indistinguishable from
well-studied ones in the local universe, providing support for the use of SNe Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any significant deviations of the SN spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the SN photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.},

	abstract = {Significant observational effort has been devoted to determining volumetric type Ia supernova rates at high redshifts, leading to clues about the nature of Ia supernova progenitors and constraints on the iron production in the universe. A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova rates in individual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A + B model for the specific supernova rate, while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges for large specific star formation rates. Applying it outside its range of validity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia supernova rates. Moreover, the A + B model it is not directly derived from a delay time distribution. We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a simple delay time distribution composed of a prompt and a delayed component. The model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational constraints. It yields a prompt fraction of f\_\{ p\}= 0.11{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.06\} in agreement with results based on volumetric rates of type Ia
supernovae at high redshift. The model is tested against realistic star formation rates from the Illustris-1 simulation and is found to be self-consistent in the asymptotic limits. An analytic function that encapsulates the features of the new model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the data. In terms of goodness of fit, the new model is strongly preferred over the A + B model. At log (sSFR) ≳ -9 there are no constraints from observations. Observations in this regime will further constrain the delay time distribution of type Ia supernovae at short delay times.},

emission lines, making it difficult to spatially resolve their
kinematics and stellar populations using ground-based spectroscopy.
Gravitationally lensed examples provide a promising route forward, but
such objects are very rare. We describe a search in the fields of 232
galaxy clusters that has uncovered five bright (H AB {\textless} 20)
lensed galaxies with red near-infrared colors. These include MRG-M0138,
which is the brightest lensed galaxy known in the near-infrared.
Analysis of near-infrared spectra and multiband photometry confirms that
all are quiescent galaxies at z = 1.95-2.64 with stellar ages of
0.5-1.4 Gyr (corresponding to formation epochs z form
≃ 3-4) and stellar masses of \{10\}11.6-12.8 \{\vphantom{\}}μ
\vphantom{\{}\}-1 \{M\}⊙ , where μ is the magnification.
In three cases, we derive lens models and reconstruct the source
structure; these galaxies are massive (\{M\}* ≳
\{10\}11.0 \{M\}⊙ ) and follow the
mass-size relation defined by unlensed samples. In two of these
three galaxies, the main structural component is an inclined disk. Weak
emission lines are detected in four of five galaxies with high ratios [N
II]/Hα ≃ 2-6 that are inconsistent with a star
formation origin. Based on the line ratios, the Hα equivalent
widths, and the distribution and kinematics of the gas, we infer that
shocks are likely to be present in at least two galaxies and could be
present in all of the line emitters. We speculate that these could be
analogs of local galaxies in which AGN jet-driven outflows are thought
to heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. In further
papers, we will present spatially resolved measurements of the stellar
populations and kinematics of this unique sample.},

high-quality spectra (two or more spectral features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects, we could not obtain reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at I AB ∼ 23 and K AB ∼
21, with a secondary peak at K AB ∼ 24. We sample a broad redshift distribution in the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, with one peak at z ∼ 1, and another one around z ∼ 4. We have identified 13
redshift spikes at z {\textgreater} 0.65 with chance probabilities {\textless} 4 ×
10-4, some of which are clearly related to protocluster structures of sizes {\textgreater}10 Mpc. An object-to-object comparison with a multitude of other spectroscopic samples in the same field shows that our DEIMOS sample is among the best in terms of fraction of
spectroscopic failures and relative redshift accuracy. We have
determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to about 0.8\% in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well below the most pessimistic expectations. Interestingly, we find evidence for strong lensing of Lyα background emitters within the slits of 12 of our target galaxies, increasing their apparent density by about a factor of 4.

Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS).
In this paper, a complete SN sample is constructed, and the observed
(uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions (LFs) of
SNe are derived. These LFs solve two issues that have plagued previous
rate calculations for nearby SNe: the luminosity distribution of SNe and
the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175
SNe, collect photometry for every object and fit a family of light
curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The
volume-limited LFs show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian
distribution. There are notable differences in the LFs for galaxies of
different Hubble types (especially for SNe Ia). We derive the observed
fractions for the different subclasses in a complete SN sample, and find
significant fractions of SNe II-L (10 per cent), IIb (12 per cent) and
IIn (9 per cent) in the SN II sample. Furthermore, we derive the LFs and
the observed fractions of different SN subclasses in a magnitude-limited
survey with different observation intervals, and find that the LFs are
enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more `standard' with
smaller scatter, and that the LFs and fractions of SNe do not change
significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10 d. We
also discuss the LFs in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for
different SN subclasses. Some notable results are that there is not a
strong correlation between the SN LFs and the host-galaxy size, but
there might be a preference for SNe IIn to occur in small, late-type
spiral galaxies. The LFs in different inclination bins do not provide
strong evidence for extreme extinction in highly inclined galaxies,
though the sample is still small. The LFs of different SN subclasses
show significant differences. We also find that SNe Ibc and IIb come
from more luminous galaxies than SNe II-P, while SNe IIn come from less
luminous galaxies, suggesting a possible metallicity effect. The
limitations and applications of our LFs are also discussed.},

of the observed rates of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe,
determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). We have
considered a sample of ∼1000 SNe and used an optimal subsample of
726 SNe (274 SNe Ia, 116 SNe Ibc and 324 SNe II) to determine our rates.
We study the trend of the rates as a function of a few quantities
available for our galaxy sample, such as luminosity in the B and K
bands, stellar mass and morphological class. We discuss different
choices (SN samples, input SN luminosity functions, inclination
correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their
uncertainties. A comparison between our SN rates and the published
measurements shows that they are consistent with each other to within
the uncertainties when the rate calculations are done in the same
manner. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the rates cannot be
adequately described by a single parameter using either galaxy Hubble
types or B-K colours. A secondary parameter in galaxy 'size', expressed
by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately describe the
rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes have
higher SN rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the
SN rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are
discussed. We examine possible causes for the rate-size relation.
Physically, such a relation for the core-collapse SNe is probably linked
to the correlation between the specific star-formation rate and the
galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether the same link can be
established for SNe Ia. We discuss the two-component ('tardy' and
'prompt') model for SN Ia rates, and find that the SN Ia rates in young
stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the
core-collapse SN rates. We derive volumetric rates for the different SN
types [e.g. for SNe Ia, a rate of (0.301 ± 0.062) ×
10-4 SN Mpc-3 yr-1 at redshift 0] and
compare them to the measurements at different redshifts. Finally, we
estimate the SN rate for the Milky Way Galaxy to be 2.84 ± 0.60
SNe per century (with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of ∼2),
consistent with published SN rates based on several different
techniques.},

family of solutions that are essentially exponential DTDs, similar in
shape to the β ≈ ‑1 power-law DTDs, but with more delayed
events ({\textgreater}1 Gyr in age) than prompt events ({\textless}1 Gyr). Comparing
these solutions to delay time measures separately derived from field
galaxies and galaxy clusters, we find the skew-normal solutions can
accommodate both without requiring a different DTD form in different
environments. These model fits are generally inconsistent with results
from single-degenerate binary population synthesis models, and are
seemingly supportive of double-degenerate progenitors for most SN Ia

cluster MACS J1149.5+2223. We use the observed positions of a large set
of spectroscopically selected multiple images, including those of
supernova "Refsdal" with their estimated time delays. Starting from our
reference model in a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, published in Grillo et
al. (2018), we confirm the relevance of the longest measurable time
delay, between SX and S1, and an approximately linear relation between
its value and that of \$H\_\{0\}\$. We perform true blind tests by
considering a range of time delays around its original estimate of \$345
{\textbackslash}pm 10\$ days, as an accurate measurement of this time delay was not
known at the time of analysis and writing. We investigate separately the
impact of a constant sheet of mass at the cluster redshift, of a
power-law profile for the mass density of the cluster main halo and of
some scatter in the cluster member scaling relations. Remarkably, we
find that these systematic effects do not introduce a significant bias
on the inferred values of \$H\_\{0\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ and that the
statistical uncertainties dominate the total error budget: a 3\%
uncertainty on the time delay of image SX translates into approximately
6\% and 40\% (including both statistical and systematic \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$)
uncertainties for \$H\_\{0\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$, respectively.
Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces the extended surface
brightness distribution of the supernova host, covering more than \$3
{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ \$HST\$ pixels. We also present the interesting possibility
of measuring the value of the equation-of-state parameter \$w\$ of the
dark energy density, currently with a 30\% uncertainty. We conclude that
time-delay cluster lenses have the potential to become soon an
alternative and competitive cosmological probe.},

spectra due to microlensing are typically negligible ({\textless}1\% distortion
within the 68\% credible region, and {\textasciitilde}10\% distortion within the 95\%
credible region). This shows great prospects of using lensed SNe Ia to
obtain intrinsic early-phase SN spectra for deciphering SN Ia
progenitors. As a demonstration of the usefulness of lensed SNe Ia for
cosmology, we simulate a sample of mock lensed SN Ia systems that are
expected to have accurate and precise time-delay measurements in the era
of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Adopting realistic yet
conservative uncertainties on their time-delay distances and lens
angular diameter distances (of 6.6\% and 5\%, respectively), we find that
a sample of 20 lensed SNe Ia would allow a constraint on the Hubble
constant (\$H\_0\$) with 1.3\% uncertainty in the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM
cosmology. We find a similar constraint on \$H\_0\$ in an open \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM

This Science Requirements Document (SRD) quantifies the expected dark energy constraining power of these probes individually and together, with conservative assumptions about analysis methodology and follow-up observational resources based on our current understanding and the expected evolution within the field in the coming years. We then define requirements on analysis pipelines that will enable us to achieve our goal of carrying out a dark energy analysis consistent with the Dark Energy Task Force definition of a Stage IV dark energy experiment. This is achieved through a forecasting process that incorporates the flowdown to detailed requirements on multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Future versions of this document will include evolution in our software capabilities and analysis plans along with updates to the LSST survey strategy.},

	abstract = {CMB observables have largely fixed the expansion history of the universe in the deceleration regime and provided two self-calibrated absolute standards for dark energy studies: the sound horizon at recombination as a standard ruler and the amplitude of initial density fluctuations.  We review these inferences and expose the testable assumptions about recombination and reionization that underly them.  Fixing the
deceleration regime with CMB observables, deviations in the distance and growth observables appear most strongly at z=0 implying that accurate calibration of local and CMB standards may be more important than redshift range or depth.  The single most important complement to the CMB for measuring the dark energy equation of state at z ˜ 0.5 is a determination of the Hubble constant to better than a few percent. Counterintuitively, with fixed fractional distance errors and relative standards such as SNe, the Hubble constant measurement is best achieved in the high redshift deceleration regime. Degeneracies between the evolution and current value of the equation of state or between its value and spatial curvature can be broken if percent level measurement and calibration of distance standards can be made at intermediate redshifts or the growth function at any redshift in the acceleration regime.   We compare several dark energy probes available to a wide and deep optical survey: baryon features in galaxy angular power spectra and the growth rate from galaxy-galaxy lensing, shear tomography and the cluster abundance.},

Hubble constant based on a calibration of the tip of the red giant
branch (TRGB) applied to Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We find a value of
H 0 = 69.8 ± 0.8 (±1.1\% stat) ± 1.7
(±2.4\% sys) km s-1 Mpc-1. The
TRGB method is both precise and accurate and is parallel to but
independent of the Cepheid distance scale. Our value sits midway in the
range defined by the current Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2σ
level with that of the Planck Collaboration et al. estimate and at the
1.7σ level with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) SHoES measurement
of H 0 based on the Cepheid distance scale. The TRGB
distances have been measured using deep HST Advanced Camera for Surveys
imaging of galaxy halos. The zero-point of the TRGB calibration is set
with a distance modulus to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.477 ±
0.004 (stat) ± 0.020 (sys) mag, based on measurement of 20
late-type detached eclipsing binary stars, combined with an HST parallax
calibration of a 3.6 μm Cepheid Leavitt law based on Spitzer
observations. We anchor the TRGB distances to galaxies that extend our
measurement into the Hubble flow using the recently completed Carnegie
Supernova Project I ( CSP-I ) sample containing about 100 well-observed
SNe Ia . There are several advantages of halo TRGB distance measurements
relative to Cepheid variables; these include low halo reddening, minimal
effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only a shallow
(calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I band, and no need for
multiple epochs of observations or concerns of different slopes with
period. In addition, the host masses of our TRGB host-galaxy sample are
higher, on average, than those of the Cepheid sample, better matching
the range of host-galaxy masses in the CSP-I distant sample and reducing
potential systematic effects in the SNe Ia measurements.

the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million
galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift
range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from
the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance
Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model, the DR11
sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region
of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the
correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field
reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at
a significance of over 7σ in both the correlation function and
power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features
measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch,
rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in
our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25
Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV =
(2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At
1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance
constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering
along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z =

of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) observations obtained by the SDSS-II and
SNLS collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples
(z{\textless} 0.1), all three seasons from the SDSS-II (0.05 Methods: We followed the methods and assumptions of the
SNLS three-year data analysis except for the following important
improvements: 1) the addition of the full SDSS-II
spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample in both the training of the
SALT2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 SNe); 2)
intercalibration of the SNLS and SDSS surveys and reduced systematic
uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with
respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of
systematic errors associated with the SALT2 modeling of SN Ia light
curves. Results: We produce recalibrated SN Ia light curves and
associated distances for the SDSS-II and SNLS samples. The large SDSS-II
sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble
diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in
the low-z SN sample. For a flat ΛCDM cosmology, we find
Ωm =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent
with the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement from
the Planck and WMAP experiments. Our result is 1.8σ (stat+sys)
different than the previously published result of SNLS three-year data.
The change is due primarily to improvements in the SNLS photometric
calibration. When combined with CMB constraints, we measure a constant
dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 ± 0.057
(stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation
distance measurements gives similar constraints: w =-1.027 ±
0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints
to date on the nature of dark energy.

	abstract = {Time delays of gravitationally lensed sources can be used to constrain 
the mass model of a deflector and determine cosmological parameters. We
here present an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply
imaged sources behind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with
well-calibrated mass models. We find that for time delays less than 1000
days, at z = 3.0, their logarithmic probability distribution functions
are well represented by P(log Δt) = 5.3 ×
10-4Δttilde
beta/M2502tilde beta, with tilde beta =
0.77, where M250 is the projected cluster mass inside 250 kpc
(in 1014M⊙), and tilde beta is the power-law
slope of the distribution. The resultant probability distribution
function enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensing
cluster of known mass. For a cluster with M250 = 2 ×
1014M⊙, the fraction of time delays less
than 1000 days is approximately 3\%. Taking Abell 1689 as an example, its
dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity dispersions
σ{\textgreater}=500kms-1, mainly produce large time delays,
while galaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller
time delays. We estimate the probability of observing multiple images of
a supernova in the known images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of
estimating the supernova rate is applied in this work. For a magnitude
threshold of mAB = 26.5, the yearly rate of Type Ia
(core-collapse) supernovae with time delays less than 1000 days is
0.004±0.002 (0.029±0.001). If the magnitude threshold is
lowered to mAB {\textasciitilde} 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae
suitable for time delay observation is 0.044±0.015 per year.},

the image subtraction process is non-trivial, and existing solutions
suffer from a variety of problems. Starting from basic statistical
principles, we develop the optimal statistic for transient detection,
flux measurement, and any image-difference hypothesis testing. We derive
a closed-form statistic that: (1) is mathematically proven to be the
optimal transient detection statistic in the limit of
background-dominated noise, (2) is numerically stable, (3) for
accurately registered, adequately sampled images, does not leave
subtraction or deconvolution artifacts, (4) allows automatic transient
detection to the theoretical sensitivity limit by providing credible
detection significance, (5) has uncorrelated white noise, (6) is a
sufficient statistic for any further statistical test on the difference
image, and, in particular, allows us to distinguish particle hits and
other image artifacts from real transients, (7) is symmetric to the
exchange of the new and reference images, (8) is at least an order of
magnitude faster to compute than some popular methods, and (9) is
straightforward to implement. Furthermore, we present extensions of this
method that make it resilient to registration errors, color-refraction
errors, and any noise source that can be modeled. In addition, we show
that the optimal way to prepare a reference image is the proper image
coaddition presented in Zackay \& Ofek. We demonstrate this method on
simulated data and real observations from the PTF data release 2. We

Finally, we reconstruct the source image of the host galaxy, and position the SN on one of its spiral arms. Products of this lens model are available to the community through MAST.

	abstract = {We present an improved determination of the Hubble constant from Hubble 
Space Telescope (HST) observations of 70 long-period Cepheids in the
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). These were obtained with the same WFC3
photometric system used to measure extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts
of SNe Ia. Gyroscopic control of HST was employed to reduce overheads
while collecting a large sample of widely separated Cepheids. The
Cepheid period-luminosity relation provides a
zero-point-independent link with 0.4\% precision between the new 1.2\%
geometric distance to the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs)
measured by Pietrzyński et al. and the luminosity of SNe Ia.
Measurements and analysis of the LMC Cepheids were completed prior to
knowledge of the new DEB LMC distance. Combined with a refined
calibration of the count-rate linearity of WFC3-IR with 0.1\% precision,
these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in
the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the
LMC from 2.5\% to 1.3\%. Using only the LMC DEBs to calibrate the ladder,
we find H 0 = 74.22 ± 1.82 km s-1
Mpc-1 including systematic uncertainties, 3\% higher
than before for this particular anchor. Combining the LMC DEBs, masers
in NGC 4258, and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H
0 = 74.03 ± 1.42 km s-1
Mpc-1, including systematics, an uncertainty of
1.91\%-15\% lower than our best previous result. Removing any one of
these anchors changes H 0 by less than 0.7\%. The difference
between H 0 measured locally and the value inferred from
Planck CMB and ΛCDM is 6.6 ± 1.5 km s-1
Mpc-1 or 4.4σ (P = 99.999\% for Gaussian errors)
in significance, raising the discrepancy beyond a plausible level of
chance. We summarize independent tests showing that this discrepancy is
not attributable to an error in any one source or measurement,
increasing the odds that it results from a cosmological feature beyond
ΛCDM.},

radiation or faster at later times can solve the Hubble tension. In these models, the sound horizon at decoupling is reduced resulting in a larger value of the Hubble parameter H0 inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We consider two physical models for this EDE, one involving an oscillating scalar field and another a slowly rolling field. We perform a detailed calculation of the evolution of perturbations in these models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo search of the parameter space for the EDE parameters, in conjunction with the standard cosmological parameters, identifies regions in which H0 inferred from Planck CMB data agrees with the SH0ES local measurement. In these cosmologies, current baryon acoustic oscillation and supernova data are described as successfully as in the cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant, while the fit to Planck data is slightly improved. Future CMB and large-scale-structure surveys will further probe this scenario.},

Our model includes 12 new multiply imaged galaxies, bringing the total to 22, composed of 65 individual lensed images. Unlike the first two HFF clusters, Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1-2403, MACS J1149 does not reveal as many multiple images in the HFF data. Using the LENSTOOL software package and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster with several cluster-scale dark matter haloes and additional galaxy-scale haloes for the cluster members. Consistent with previous analyses, we find the system to be complex, composed of five cluster-scale haloes. Their spatial distribution and lower mass, however, makes MACS J1149 a less powerful lens. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms of 0.91 arcsec. We measure the total projected mass inside a 200-kpc aperture as (1.840 ± 0.006) × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, thus reaching again 1 per cent precision, following our previous HFF analyses of MACS J0416.1-2403 and Abell 2744. In light of the discovery of the first resolved quadruply lensed supernova, SN Refsdal, in one of the multiply imaged galaxies identified in MACS J1149, we use our revised mass model to investigate the time delays and predict the rise of the next image between 2015 November and 2016 January.},

	abstract = {The Hubble tension can be significantly eased if there is an early 
component of dark energy that becomes active around the time of
matter-radiation equality. Early dark energy models suffer from a
coincidence problem---the physics of matter-radiation equality and early
dark energy are completely disconnected, so some degree of fine-tuning
is needed in order for them to occur nearly simultaneously. In this
paper we propose a natural explanation for this coincidence. If the
early dark energy scalar couples to neutrinos then it receives a large
injection of energy around the time that neutrinos become
non-relativistic. This is precisely when their temperature is of order
their mass, which, coincidentally, occurs around the time of
matter-radiation equality. Neutrino decoupling therefore provides a
natural trigger for early dark energy by displacing the field from its
minimum just before matter-radiation equality. We discuss various
theoretical aspects of this proposal, potential observational
signatures, and future directions for its study.},

, which can help reduce somewhat the tension between the CMB and weak lensing or Cepheids data sets. Here we show that it is impossible to solve both tensions simultaneously.

H0=72.1-1.7+1.5 km /s /Mpc , when Neff is free to vary), the σ8 parameter
remains too large to reduce the σ8 tension. Adding high multipole Planck polarization data does not help since this data shows a strong preference for low values of H0, thus worsening current tensions, even though they also prefer smaller value of

These are the first solutions of this kind in which the field evolution and fluctuations are consistently implemented using the equations of motion.

We construct mean light curve (LC) templates using a hierarchical Bayesian model. We explore both Gaussian process (GP) and template methods for fitting the LCs and estimating distances, while including peculiar-velocity and photometric uncertainties. For the 56 SNe Ia with both optical and NIR observations near maximum light, the GP method yields a NIR-only Hubble-diagram with a root mean square (rms) of 0.117 +/-  0.014 mag when referenced to the NIR maxima. For each NIR band, a comparable GP method rms is obtained when referencing to NIR-max or B-max. Using NIR LC templates referenced to B-max yields a larger rms value of 0.138 +/- 0.014 mag. Fitting the corresponding optical data using standard LC fitters that use LC shape and color corrections yields larger rms values of 0.179 ± 0.018 mag with SALT2 and 0.174 +/-  0.021 mag with

host-galaxy dust reddening, provides smaller rms in the inferred distances, at the ∼2.3–4.1σ level, than standard optical
methods that correct for those effects. Our ongoing RAISIN program on the Hubble Space Telescope will exploit this promising infrared approach to limit systematic errors when measuring the expansion history of the universe in order to constrain dark energy.},

	abstract = {The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will detect many 
strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) for time-delay cosmography.
This will provide an independent and direct way for measuring the Hubble
constant H0, which is necessary to address the current
4.4σ tension in H0 between the local distance ladder
and the early Universe measurements. We present a detailed analysis of
different observing strategies (also referred to as cadence strategy)
for the LSST, and quantify their impact on time-delay measurement
between multiple images of LSNe Ia. For this, we simulated observations
by using mock LSNe Ia for which we produced mock-LSST light curves that
account for microlensing. Furthermore, we used the free-knot splines
estimator from the software PyCS to measure the time delay from the
simulated observations. We find that using only LSST data for time-delay
cosmography is not ideal. Instead, we advocate using LSST as a discovery
machine for LSNe Ia, enabling time delay measurements from follow-up
observations from other instruments in order to increase the number of
systems by a factor of 2-16 depending on the observing strategy.
Furthermore, we find that LSST observing strategies, which provide a
good sampling frequency (the mean inter-night gap is around two days)
and high cumulative season length (ten seasons with a season length of
around 170 days per season), are favored. Rolling cadences subdivide the
survey and focus on different parts in different years; these observing
strategies trade the number of seasons for better sampling frequency. In
our investigation, this leads to half the number of systems in
comparison to the best observing strategy. Therefore rolling cadences
are disfavored because the gain from the increased sampling frequency
cannot compensate for the shortened cumulative season length. We
anticipate that the sample of lensed SNe Ia from our preferred LSST
cadence strategies with rapid follow-up observations would yield an
independent percent-level constraint on H0.},

NIRCam consists of two optics modules, each with a field of view of 2.2 arcmin square. The modules are identical except for the mechanical layout. Each module consists of two channels divided by a dichroic beamsplitter. The short wavelength channel has a band pass of 0.6 - 2.3 microns, with pixels sized for Nyquist sampling of the PSF at 2.0 microns. The long
wavelength channel has a band pass of 2.4 - 5.0 microns, with pixels sized for Nyquist sampling at 4.0 microns. Selections of wide (R{\textasciitilde}4), intermediate (R{\textasciitilde}10), and narrow (R{\textasciitilde}100) bandwidth filters are provided in each of the four channels, along with coronagraphic occulting masks and pupil stops. A refractive optical design results in a smaller instrument volume and mass, provides good images at the pupils for wavefront sensing and coronagraphy, allows good access to the pupils and focal planes, and relaxes the alignment requirements compared to a reflective design.

	abstract = {Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is widely used for the analysis 
of remotely sensed images. Hyperspectral imagery includes varying bands
of images. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most
frequently used deep learning based methods for visual data processing.
The use of CNN for HSI classification is also visible in recent works.
These approaches are mostly based on 2D CNN. Whereas, the HSI
classification performance is highly dependent on both spatial and
spectral information. Very few methods have utilized the 3D CNN because
of increased computational complexity. This letter proposes a Hybrid
Spectral Convolutional Neural Network (HybridSN) for HSI classification.
Basically, the HybridSN is a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by spatial
2D-CNN. The 3D-CNN facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature
representation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2D-CNN on top of the
3D-CNN further learns more abstract level spatial representation.
Moreover, the use of hybrid CNNs reduces the complexity of the model
compared to 3D-CNN alone. To test the performance of this hybrid
approach, very rigorous HSI classification experiments are performed
over Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas Scene remote sensing
datasets. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art
hand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning based methods. A very
satisfactory performance is obtained using the proposed HybridSN for HSI
classification. The source code can be found at

∼700 000 galaxy spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release
7 that have star-formation histories (SFHs) derived with the VErsatile
SPectral Analysis code (VESPA). We use the SN Ia sample to measure SN Ia
rates per unit stellar mass. We confirm, at the median redshift of the
sample, z = 0.1, the inverse dependence on galaxy mass of the SN Ia rate
per unit mass, previously reported by Li et al. for a local sample. We
further confirm, following Kistler et al., that this relation can be
explained by the combination of galaxy `downsizing' and a power-law
delay-time distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse
between a hypothetical burst of star formation and the subsequent SN Ia
explosions) with an index of -1, inherent to the double-degenerate
progenitor scenario. We use the method of Maoz et al. to recover the DTD
by comparing the number of SNe Ia hosted by each galaxy in our sample
with the VESPA-derived SFH of the stellar population within the spectral
aperture. In this galaxy sample, which is dominated by old and massive
galaxies, we recover a `delayed' component to the DTD of 4.5 ±
0.6 (statistical)-0.5+0.3 (systematic) ×
10- 14 SNe M⊙- 1 yr- 1

averaged over all masses and redshifts in our galaxy sample, is

	abstract = {Neutrinos play a crucial role in the collapse and explosion of massive stars, governing the infall dynamics of the stellar core, triggering and fueling the explosion and driving the cooling and deleptonization of the newly formed neutron star. Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of the explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only direct probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova. In this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics and signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the capability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield faithful
information of the time and flavor-dependent neutrino signal from a future Galactic supernova. We show how the observable neutrino burst would provide a benchmark for fundamental supernova physics with unprecedented richness of detail. Exploiting the treasure of the measured neutrino events requires a careful discrimination of
source-generated properties from signal features that originate on the way to the detector. As for the latter, we discuss self-induced flavor conversions associated with neutrino-neutrino interactions that occur in the deepest stellar regions; matter effects that modify the pattern of flavor conversions in the dynamical stellar envelope;
neutrino-oscillation signatures that result from structural features associated with the shock-wave propagation as well as turbulent mass motions in post-shock layers. Finally, we highlight our current
understanding of the formation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background and we analyse the perspectives for a detection of this relic signal that integrates the contributions from all past core-collapse supernovae in the Universe.},

With the recent measurement of H0 this tension has raised to more than 3 σ. We consider changes in the early time physics without modifying the late time cosmology. We also reconstruct the late time expansion history in a model independent way with minimal assumptions using distance measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, finding that at z {\textless} 0.6 the recovered shape of the
expansion history is less than 5\% different than that of a standard ΛCDM model. These probes also provide a model insensitive
constraint on the low-redshift standard ruler, measuring directly the combination rsh where H0 = h × 100
Mpc-1km/s and rs is the sound horizon at
radiation drag (the standard ruler), traditionally constrained by CMB observations. Thus rs and H0 provide absolute scales for distance measurements (anchors) at opposite ends of the observable Universe. We calibrate the cosmic distance ladder and obtain a model-independent determination of the standard ruler for acoustic scale, rs. The tension in H0 reflects a mismatch between our determination of rs and its standard,
CMB-inferred value. Without including high-l Planck CMB polarization data (i.e., only considering the ``recommended baseline" low-l
polarisation and temperature and the high l temperature data), a modification of the early-time physics to include a component of dark radiation with an effective number of species around 0.4 would reconcile the CMB-inferred constraints, and the local H0 and standard ruler determinations. The inclusion of the ``preliminary" high-l Planck CMB polarisation data disfavours this solution.},

	abstract = {Most massive stars, the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, are in 
close binary systems and may interact with their companion through mass
transfer or merging. We undertake a population synthesis study to
compute the delay-time distribution of core-collapse supernovae, that
is, the supernova rate versus time following a starburst, taking into
account binary interactions. We test the systematic robustness of our
results by running various simulations to account for the uncertainties
in our standard assumptions. We find that a significant fraction, \%, of
core-collapse supernovae are "late", that is, they occur 50-200 Myr
after birth, when all massive single stars have already exploded. These
late events originate predominantly from binary systems with at least
one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of intermediate
mass (4-8 M⊙). The main evolutionary channels that
contribute often involve either the merging of the initially more
massive primary star with its companion or the engulfment of the
remaining core of the primary by the expanding secondary that has
accreted mass at an earlier evolutionary stage. Also, the total number
of core-collapse supernovae increases by \% because of binarity for the
same initial stellar mass. The high rate implies that we should have
already observed such late core-collapse supernovae, but have not
recognized them as such. We argue that φ Persei is a likely
progenitor and that eccentric neutron star - white dwarf systems are
likely descendants. Late events can help explain the discrepancy in the
delay-time distributions derived from supernova remnants in the
Magellanic Clouds and extragalactic type Ia events, lowering the
contribution of prompt Ia events. We discuss ways to test these
predictions and speculate on the implications for supernova feedback in
simulations of galaxy evolution.},

empirical iron yields of the various SN types, we re-derive the cosmic
iron accumulation history. Core-collapse SNe and SNe Ia have contributed
about equally to the total mass of iron in the universe today. We find
the track of the average cosmic gas element in the [α/Fe] versus
[Fe/H] abundance-ratio plane. The track is broadly similar to the
observed main locus of Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky
Way (MW) SFH similar in form to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple
MW SFH that makes the track closely match this stellar locus. Galaxy
clusters appear to have a higher-normalization DTD. This cluster DTD,
combined with a short-burst MW SFH peaked at z = 3, produces a track
that matches remarkably well the observed “high-α”
locus of MW stars, suggesting the halo/thick-disk population has had a
galaxy-cluster-like formation mode. Thus, a simple two-component SFH,
combined with empirical DTDs and SN iron yields, suffices to closely
reproduce the MW’s stellar abundance patterns.},

While much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function, is a key tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution. The past decade has seen a growing variety of methods for measuring or inferring the initial mass function. This range of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting conclusions regarding whether or not the initial mass function is universal. Here I review this growing wealth of approaches, and highlight the importance of considering potential initial mass function variations, reinforcing the need to carefully quantify the scope and uncertainties of
measurements. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the initial mass function and promote clarity in the further development of this fundamental field.},

It has long been clear that a SN Ia must be the runaway thermonuclear explosion of a degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core, most likely a white dwarf (WD). However, the specific progenitor systems of SNe Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered:
single-degenerate (SD), in which a WD gains mass from a nondegenerate star; and double-degenerate (DD), involving the merger of two WDs. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of SN Ia sites—pre- and
postexplosion—from analysis of the explosions themselves and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, SN 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive and sometimes prone to competing
theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that DD
progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, SNe Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

energies approaching 1053 erg, these supernovae are expected

properties of the first stars. We estimate the source density of PISNe
using a semi-analytic halo mass function based approach, accounting for
the effects of feedback from star formation on the PISN rate using
cosmological simulations. We estimate an upper limit of {\textasciitilde}0.2 PISNe per
JWST field of view at any given time. Feedback can reduce this rate
significantly, e.g., lowering it to as little as one PISN per 4000 JWST
fields of view for the most pessimistic explosion models. We also find
that the main obstacle to observing PISNe from the first stars is their
scarcity, not their faintness; exposures longer than a few times
104 s will do little to increase the number of PISNe found.
Given this, we suggest a mosaic style search strategy for detecting
PISNe from the first stars. Even rather high-redshift PISNe are unlikely
to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number of pointings will
be required to ensure a detection.},

We quantify the discovery potential of such surveys, and apply our results to upcoming projects, including DES, Pan-STARRS, and LSST. The latter two will harvest core-collapse supernovae in numbers orders of magnitude greater than have ever been observed to date. These surveys will map out the cosmic core-collapse supernova redshift distribution via direct counting, with very small statistical uncertainties out to a redshift depth which is a strong function of the survey limiting magnitude. This supernova redshift history encodes rich information about cosmology, star
formation, and supernova astrophysics and phenomenology; the large statistics of the supernova sample will be crucial to disentangle possible degeneracies among these issues. For example, the cosmic supernova rate can be measured to high precision out to z {\textasciitilde} 0.5 for all core-collapse types, and out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 1 for Type IIn events if their intrinsic properties remain the same as those measured locally. A precision knowledge of the cosmic supernova rate would remove the cosmological uncertainties in the study of the wealth of observable properties of the cosmic supernova populations and their evolution with environment and redshift. Because of the tight link between supernovae and star formation, synoptic sky surveys will also provide precision measurements of the normalization and z lap 1 history of cosmic
star-formation rate in a manner independent of and complementary to than current data based on UV and other proxies for massive star formation. Furthermore, Type II supernovae can serve as distance indicators and would independently cross-check Type Ia distances measured in the same surveys. Arguably the largest and least-controlled uncertainty in all of these efforts comes from the poorly-understood evolution of dust obscuration of supernovae in their host galaxies; we outline a strategy to determine empirically the obscuration properties by leveraging the large supernova samples over a broad range of redshift. We conclude with recommendations on how best to use (and to tailor) these galaxy surveys to fully extract unique new probes on the physics, astrophysics, and cosmology of core-collapse explosions.},

β. The parameter τIa can also be constrained to
within an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}1-2 Gyr without knowing α, which is
somewhat degenerate with τIa. This might be achieved by
ground-based surveys but depends on the still highly uncertain type
classification by imaging data. More reliable classification will be
achieved by the SNAP mission. The supernova counts at a magnitude level
of IAB or KAB{\textasciitilde}30 will allow us to break
degeneracies between α and τIa and independently
constrain all three parameters, even without knowing supernova types.
This can be achieved by the SNAP and JWST missions, which have the
different strengths of larger statistics and reaching to higher

deg-2 yr-1 at z{\textasciitilde}15 and 0.2 deg-2 yr-1 at z{\textasciitilde}25, both with substantial uncertainty. Although such supernovae (SNe) would be bright enough to be readily detectable with the JWST at any relevant redshift, the lower number densities derived here would likely require either a dedicated wide-angle search strategy or a serendipitous search. We expect that typically about 1 deg2 (or 500 JWST NIRCam images) at 4.5 μm must be imaged to detect one PISN at z{\textasciitilde}15 and about 35 deg2 to detect one at z{\textasciitilde}25. If some Population III star formation persists to lower redshifts at z{\textasciitilde}5, then PISNe may also be detectable in wide-angle ground-based Z-band imaging surveys at ZAB{\textasciitilde}23, at a density of the order of 1 deg-2 of surveyed area. In the Appendix we consider the possible effects of intergalactic dust in obscuring high-redshift SNe or other high-redshift sources. We show that the obscuration at a given rest wavelength will peak at some maximum redshift and thereafter decline.

	abstract = {Using observed star formation rates at redshifts up to z {\textasciitilde} 5, we calculate cosmic supernova rates for core collapse and Type Ia
supernovae. Together with supernova statistics and detailed light curves, we estimate the number of supernovae, and their distribution in redshift, that should be detectable in different filters with various instruments, including both existing and future telescopes, in
particular the NGST. We find that the NGST should detect several tens of core collapse supernovae in a single frame. Most of these will be core collapse supernovae with 1 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2, but about one third will
have z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2. Rates at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 5 are highly uncertain. For ground
based 8-10 m class telescopes we predict {\textasciitilde} 0.1 supernova per square arcmin to IAB = 27, with about twice as many core collapse SNe as Type Ia's. The typical redshift will be z {\textasciitilde} 1, with an extended tail up to z {\textasciitilde} 2. Detectability of high redshift supernovae from ground is highly sensitive to the rest frame UV flux of the supernova, where line blanketing may decrease the rates severely in filters below 1 mu m. In addition to the standard `Madau' star formation rate, we discuss alternative models with flat star formation rate at high redshifts. Especially for supernovae at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2 the rates of these models differ considerably, when seen as a function of redshift. An advantage of using SNe to study the instantaneous star formation rate is that the SN rest frame optical to NIR is less affected by dust extinction than the UV-light. However, if a large fraction of the star formation occurs in galaxies with a very large extinction the observed SN rate will be strongly affected. An additional advantage of using SNe is that these are not sensitive to selection effects caused by low surface brightness. Different aspects of the search strategy is discussed, and it is especially pointed out that unless the time interval between the observations spans at least 100 days for ground based searches, and one year for NGST, a large fraction of the Type IIP supernovae will be lost. Because of the time delay between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion, observations of z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 Type Ia supernovae may distinguish different progenitor scenarios. A major problem is the determination of the redshift of these faint supernovae, and various alternatives are discussed, including photometric redshifts. In practice a reliable classification based on either spectroscopy or light curves requires the SNe to be {\textasciitilde} 2 magnitudes above the detection limit. The uncertainties in the estimates are discussed extensively. We also discuss how the estimated rates depend on cosmology. Finally, some comments on effects of metallicity are included.},

	abstract = {The distance-redshift relation plays a fundamental role in constraining cosmological models. In this paper, we show that measurements of positions and time delays of strongly lensed images of a background galaxy, as well as those of the velocity dispersion and mass profile of a lens galaxy, can be combined to extract the angular diameter distance of the lens galaxy. Physically, as the velocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential (GM/r) and a mass (GM) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physical size (r) of the lens. Comparing the physical size with the image positions of a lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. A mismatch between the exact locations at which these measurements are made can be corrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. We expand on the original idea put forward by Paraficz and Hjorth, who analyzed singular
isothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law spherical mass density profile, an external convergence, and an
anisotropic velocity dispersion. We find that the effect of external convergence cancels out when dividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements. We derive a formula for the uncertainty in the angular diameter distance in terms of the uncertainties in the
observables. As an application, we use two existing strong lens systems, B1608+656 (zL=0.6304) and RXJ1131-1231
(zL=0.295), to show that the uncertainty in the inferred angular diameter distances is dominated by that in the velocity
dispersion, σ2, and its anisotropy. We find that the
current data on these systems should yield about 16\% uncertainty in DA per object. This improves to 13\% when we measure
σ2 at the so-called sweet-spot radius. Achieving 7\% is possible if we can determine σ2 with 5\% precision.},

parameter, w, are 0.042 (stat) and 0.059 (stat+syst) at 68\% confidence.
We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly
equal contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias
corrections, and instrumental bias corrections. We also include several
new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample is less than
one-third the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on w are only
larger by 1.4×, showing the impact of the DES-SN Ia light-curve
quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization
parameters of the DES-SNe Ia are in agreement with earlier SN Ia samples
such as Pan-STARRS1 and the Supernova Legacy Survey. However, we find
smaller intrinsic scatter about the Hubble diagram (0.077 mag).
Interestingly, we find no evidence for a Hubble residual step (0.007
± 0.018 mag) as a function of host-galaxy mass for the DES
subset, in 2.4σ tension with previous measurements. We also
present novel validation methods of our sample using simulated SNe Ia
inserted in DECam images and using large catalog-level simulations to
test for biases in our analysis pipelines.},

	abstract = {Improvement in the precision of measurements of cosmological parameters 
with Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) is expected to come from large
photometrically identified (photometric) SN samples. Here we re-analyse
the SDSS photometric SN sample, with roughly 700 high-quality, likely
but unconfirmed SNIa light-curves, to develop new analysis tools aimed
at evaluating systematic uncertainties on the dark energy
equation-of-state parameter \$w\$. Since we require a spectroscopically
measured host galaxy redshift for each SN, we determine the associated
selection efficiency of host galaxies in order to simulate bias
corrections. We determine that the mis-association rate of host galaxies
is \$0.6{\textbackslash}\%\$; ignoring this effect in simulated bias corrections leads to
a \$w\$-bias of \${\textbackslash}Delta w = +0.0007\$, where \$w\$ is evaluated from SNIa and
priors from measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and the cosmic
microwave background. We assess the uncertainty in our modeling of the
host galaxy selection efficiency and find the associated \$w\$ uncertainty
to be \$-0.0072\$. Finally, we explore new core collapse (CC) models in
simulated training samples and find that adjusting the CC luminosity
distribution to be in agreement with previous Pan-STARRS analyses yields
a better match to the SDSS data. The impact of ignoring this adjustment
is \${\textbackslash}Delta w = -0.0109\$; the impact of replacing the new CC models with
those used by Pan-STARRS is \${\textbackslash}Delta w = -0.0028\$. These systematic
uncertainties are subdominant to the statistical constraints from the
SDSS sample, but must be considered in future photometric analyses of
large SN samples such as those from DES, LSST and WFIRST.},

light curves in the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and in
low-redshift samples from the Center for Astrophysics (CfA) and the
Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). These simulations are used to model
biases from selection effects and light-curve analysis and to determine
bias corrections for SN Ia distance moduli that are used to measure
cosmological parameters. To generate realistic light curves, the
simulation uses a detailed SN Ia model, incorporates information from
observations (point spread function, sky noise, zero-point), and uses
summary information (e.g. detection efficiency versus signal-to-noise
ratio) based on 10 000 fake SN light curves whose fluxes were overlaid
on images and processed with our analysis pipelines. The quality of the
simulation is illustrated by predicting distributions observed in the
data. Averaging within redshift bins, we find distance modulus biases up
to 0.05 mag over the redshift ranges of the low-z and DES-SN samples.
For individual events, particularly those with extreme red or blue
colour, distance biases can reach 0.4 mag. Therefore, accurately
determining bias corrections is critical for precision measurements of
cosmological parameters. Files used to make these corrections are

Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved
light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with
arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe.

	abstract = {Supernova (SN) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichment and SN physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star formation histories. We have carried out a survey for SNe in galaxy clusters, at a redshift range of 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9, using the Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that were previously imaged by ACS, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster in which we discovered five likely cluster SNe, six possible cluster Type Ia supernovae, two hostless SN candidates, and several background and foreground events. Keck spectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. We conducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellar luminosities of the clusters using Subaru images. We derive a cluster SN rate of 0.35SNu B +0.17 -0.12(statistical) ±0.13(classification) ±0.01(systematic) (where SNu B
 = SNe (100 yr 1010 L B,sun)-1) and 0.112SNu M +0.055
-0.039(statistical) ±0.042(classification)
±0.005(systematic) (where SNu M = SNe (100 yr
1010 M sun)-1). As in previous
measurements of cluster SN rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics. The SN rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the SN rate in clusters at lower redshifts (to within the
uncertainties), and shows that there is, at most, only a slight increase of cluster SN rate with increasing redshift. The low and fairly constant SN Ia rate out to z ≈ 1 implies that the bulk of the iron mass in clusters was already in place by z ≈ 1. The recently observed
doubling of iron abundances in the intracluster medium between z = 1 and 0, if real, is likely to be the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than new production of iron.

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and
reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to
the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ˜1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

	abstract = {We use the Expanding Photosphere Method to determine distances to 10 Type II supernovae. The effects of asymmetries extinction, and flux dilution are explored. Using empirical evidence and time-dependent, spherical models which treat H and He in non-LTE, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux dilution are small for Type II supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical when their color temperatures are less than 6000 K. The extinction to a Type II-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than 10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution, we derive distances to 10 supernovae: SN 1968L, SN 1969L, SN 1970G, SN 1973R, SN 1979C, SN 1980K, SN 1987A, SN 1988A, SN 1990E, and SN 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc which is unique among the methods for establishing the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to SN 1970G in M 101 and SN 1987A in the LMC are in good agreement with distances determined from Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +/- 3 Mpc, is larger than recent distance estimates made using surface brightness fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher method. Using the distances determined from these Type II supernovae, we derive a value of H\_0\_ = 60+/-10 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} Mpc{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. This value is subject to errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow but will soon be improved by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant Type II supernovae.},

	abstract = {Supernovae (SNe) could be powerful probes of the properties of stars and galaxies at high redshifts in future surveys. Wide fields and longer exposure times are required to offset diminishing star formation rates and lower fluxes to detect useful numbers of events at high redshift. In principle, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) could discover large numbers of early SNe because of its wide fields but only at lower redshifts because of its AB mag limit of {\textasciitilde} 24. But gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters and massive galaxies could boost flux from ancient SNe and allow LSST to detect them at earlier times. Here, we calculate detection rates for lensed SNe at z {\textasciitilde} 5 - 7 for LSST. We find that the LSST Wide Deep Fast survey could detect up to 120 lensed Population (Pop) I and II SNe but no lensed Pop III SNe. Deep-drilling programs in a single 10 square degree FoV could detect Pop I and II core-collapse SNe and Pop III pair-instability SNe at AB magnitudes of 27 - 28 and 26, respectively. An alternative deep survey over 80 nights with a one-year cadence could find {\textasciitilde} 8 Pop III SNe.},

These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

This phenomenon facilitates observations of high-redshift supernovae (SNe) that would otherwise remain undetected. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) detections are of particular interest because of their standard brightness, since they can be used to improve either cluster lensing models or cosmological parameter measurements. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We present a ground-based, near-infrared search for lensed SNe behind the galaxy cluster Abell 370. Our survey was based on 15 epochs of J-band observations with the HAWK-I instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry to infer the global properties of the multiply-imaged galaxies. Using a recently published lensing model of Abell 370, we also present the predicted magnifications and time delays between the images. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: In our survey, we did not discover any live SNe from the 13 lensed galaxies with 47 multiple images behind Abell 370. This is consistent with the expectation of 0.09 ± 0.02 SNe calculated based on the measured star formation rate. We compare the expectations of discovering strongly lensed SNe in our survey and that performed with HST during the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) programme. We also show the expectations of search campaigns that can be conducted with future facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). We show that the NIRCam instrument aboard the JWST will be sensitive to most SN multiple images in the strongly lensed galaxies and thus will be able to measure their time delays if observations are scheduled accordingly.

This line-up allows for detailed studies of SNe at high redshift that otherwise would not be possible. Spectroscopic observations of lensed high-redshift Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are of particular interest since they can be used to test for evolution of their intrinsic properties. The use of SNe Ia for probing the cosmic expansion history has proven to be an extremely powerful method for measuring cosmological parameters. However, if systematic redshift-dependent properties are found, their usefulness for future surveys could be challenged. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We investigate whether the spectroscopic properties of the strongly lensed and very distant SN Ia PS1-10afx at z = 1.4, deviates from the well-studied populations of normal SNe Ia at nearby or intermediate distance. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We created median spectra from nearby and intermediate-redshift spectroscopically normal SNe Ia from the literature at - 5 and + 1 days from light-curve maximum. We then compared these median spectra to those of PS1-10afx. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We do not find signs of spectral evolution in PS1-10afx. The observed deviation between PS1-10afx and the median templates are within what is found for SNe at low and intermediate redshift. There is a noticeable broad feature centred at λ 3500 Å, which is present only to a lesser extent in individual low- and intermediate-redshift SN Ia spectra. From a comparison with a recently developed explosion model, we find this feature to be dominated by iron peak elements, in particular, singly ionized cobalt and chromium.},

These objects, SN CLO12Car (z = 1.28), SN CLN12Did (z = 0.85), and SN CLA11Tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters, MACSJ1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), RXJ1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and A383 (z = 0.187), respectively.

Using multi-color light-curve fits to determine a standardized SN Ia luminosity distance, we infer that SN CLO12Car was {\textasciitilde}1.0 ± 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens magnification. Similarly, SN CLN12Did is {\textasciitilde}0.2 ± 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia. We derive independent estimates of the predicted magnification from CLASH strong+weak-lensing maps of the clusters (in magnitude units, 2.5 log{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}μ): 0.83 ± 0.16 mag for SN CLO12Car, 0.28 ± 0.08 mag for SN CLN12Did, and 0.43 ± 0.11 mag for SN CLA11Tib. The two SNe Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the SN Ia brightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. Our results herald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia (from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution in clusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolute magnifications.},

	abstract = {Cadenced optical imaging surveys in the next decade will be capable of detecting time-varying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in large numbers, increasing the size of the statistically well-defined samples of multiply imaged quasars by two orders of magnitude, and discovering the first strongly lensed supernovae. We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magnification bias and image configuration detectability into account. We find that upcoming wide-field synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should find more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The LSST should also find some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with {\textasciitilde}15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be {\textasciitilde}15 per cent for the lensed quasars and {\textasciitilde}30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed double-image lenses, as could be derived from the LSST survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent confidence intervals are σ(w{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = 0.15, σ(w{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}a{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) = 0.41 and σ(h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.},

The predicted large total magnification of μ ̃ 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

	abstract = {Time delays between lensed multiple images have been known to provide an interesting probe of the Hubble constant, but such an application is often limited by degeneracies with the shape of lens potentials. We propose a new statistical approach to examine the dependence of time delays on the complexity of lens potentials, such as higher order perturbations, nonisothermality, and substructures. Specifically, we introduce a dimensionless reduced time delay and explore its behavior analytically and numerically as a function of the image configuration, which is characterized by the asymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. In particular, we derive a realistic conditional probability distribution for a given image configuration from Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the probability distribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more symmetric and/or smaller opening-angle image pairs are more easily affected by perturbations on the primary lens potential. On average time delays of double lenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses. Furthermore, the realistic conditional distribution allows a new statistical method to constrain the Hubble constant from observed time delays. We find that 16 published time delay quasars constrain H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to be 70+/-6 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, where the value and its error are estimated using jackknife resampling. Systematic errors coming from the heterogeneous nature of the quasar sample and the uncertainty of the input distribution of lens potentials can be larger than the statistical error.

Such calibrations will be crucial when next-generation Hubble Space Telescope cluster surveys (e.g. Frontier) provide magnification maps that will, in turn, form the basis for the exploration of the high-redshift Universe. We classify SNe using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two of the three to be clearly of Type Ia and the third probable. The SNe exhibit significant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at ̃5σ significance (SN-L2). We conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine-tuning of parameters, finding a mean amplification difference between SNe and the cluster lensing models of 0.09 ± 0.09{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}stat{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} ± 0.05{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}sys{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} mag.

However, the measured statistical dispersion of σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.21 mag appeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statistical uncertainties (0.14). Further work with the SN and cluster lensing models, post-unblinding, reduced the measured dispersion to σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.12. An explicit choice should thus be made as to whether SNe are used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model.

In a hypothetical 1 yr survey, it should be possible to detect up to several thousand SNe per unit redshift at z{\textasciitilde}6. We discuss the possible application of such a large sample of distant SNe as a probe of the epoch of reionization. By heating the intergalactic medium (IGM) and raising the cosmological Jeans mass, the process of reionization can suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. This could have produced a relatively sharp drop in the SN rate around the redshift of reionization (z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}re{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). We quantify the detectability of this feature in future surveys of distant SNe by varying the redshift and duration of reionization, as well as its impact on the SFR in low-mass halos, which results in different redshifts, widths, and sizes of the drop in the expected SFR. We find that the drop can be detected out to z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}re{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}13, as long as (1) the reionization history contains a relatively rapid feature that is synchronized over different regions to within ∆z\&lt;{\textasciitilde}1-3, (2) the star formation efficiency in halos that dominate reionization is ∊{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10\%, and (3) reionization significantly suppresses the star formation in low-mass halos.

As the supernova is of Type Ia where the intrinsic luminosity is usually well known, accurately measured time delays of the multiple images could provide tight constraints on the Hubble constant. According to our lens mass models constrained by the Hubble Space Telescope F814W image, we expect the maximum relative time delay to be less than a day, which is consistent with the maximum of 100 hr reported by Goobar et al. but places a stringent upper limit. Furthermore, the fluxes of most of the supernova images depart from expected values suggesting that they are affected by microlensing. The microlensing timescales are small enough that they may pose significant problems to measure the time delays reliably. Our lensing rate calculation indicates that the occurrence of a lensed SN in iPTF is likely. However, the observed total magnification of iPTF16geu is larger than expected, given its redshift. This may be a further indication of ongoing microlensing in this system.},

	abstract = {Lens time delays are a powerful probe of cosmology, provided that the gravitational potential of the main deflector can be modeled with sufficient precision. Recent work has shown that this can be achieved by detailed modeling of the host galaxies of lensed quasars, which appear as ``Einstein Rings'' in high resolution images. The distortion of these arcs and counter-arcs, as measured over a large number of pixels, provides tight constraints on the difference between the gravitational potential between the quasar image positions, and thus on cosmology in combination with the measured time delay. We carry out a systematic exploration of the high resolution imaging required to exploit the thousands of lensed quasars that will be discovered by current and upcoming surveys with the next decade. Specifically, we simulate realistic lens systems as imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and ground based adaptive optics images taken with Keck or the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). We compare the performance of these pointed observations with that of images taken by the Euclid (VIS), Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) surveys. We use as our metric the precision with which the slope γ' of the total mass density profile ρ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}tot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}propto r{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-γ'{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the main deflector can be measured. Ideally, we require that the statistical error on γ' be less than 0.02, such that it is subdominant to other sources of random and systematic uncertainties. We find that survey data will likely have sufficient depth and resolution to meet the target only for the brighter gravitational lens systems, comparable to those discovered by the SDSS survey. For fainter systems, that will be discovered by current and future surveys, targeted follow-up will be required. However, the exposure time required with upcoming facilitites such as JWST, the Keck Next Generation Adaptive Optics System, and TMT, will only be of order a few minutes per system, thus making the follow-up of hundreds of systems a practical and efficient cosmological probe.},

	abstract = {Matter near a gravitational lens galaxy or projected along the line of sight (LOS) can affect strong lensing observables by more than contemporary measurement errors. We simulate lens fields with realistic three-dimensional mass configurations (self-consistently including voids), and then fit mock lensing observables with increasingly complex lens models to quantify biases and uncertainties associated with different ways of treating the lens environment (ENV) and LOS. We identify the combination of mass, projected offset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for lensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential than background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and downweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net strength of ENV/LOS effects across different lens fields; modeling fields individually yields stronger priors for H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} than ray tracing through N-body simulations. Models that ignore mass outside the lens yield poor fits and biased results. Adding external shear can account for tidal stretching from galaxies at redshifts z≥slant \{z\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{lens{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}, but it requires corrections for external convergence and cannot reproduce nonlinear effects from foreground galaxies. Using the tidal approximation is reasonable for most perturbers as long as nonlinear redshift effects are included. Even then, the scatter in H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is limited by the lens profile degeneracy. Asymmetric image configurations produced by highly elliptical lens galaxies are less sensitive to the lens profile degeneracy, so they offer appealing targets for precision lensing analyses in future surveys like LSST and Euclid.},

The Frontier Fields combines the power of HST and Spitzer with the natural gravitational telescopes of massive high-magnification clusters of galaxies to produce the deepest observations of clusters and their lensed galaxies ever obtained. Six clusters—Abell 2744, MACSJ0416.1-2403, MACSJ0717.5+3745, MACSJ1149.5+2223, Abell S1063, and Abell 370—have been targeted by the HST ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR cameras with coordinated parallel fields for over 840 HST orbits. The parallel fields are the second-deepest observations thus far by HST with 5σ point-source depths of ̃29th ABmag. Galaxies behind the clusters experience typical magnification factors of a few, with small regions magnified by factors of 10-100. Therefore, the Frontier Field cluster HST images achieve intrinsic depths of ̃30-33 mag over very small volumes.

Time delays are most useful when observations permit detailed lens modeling and variability studies, requiring high resolution imaging, long time monitoring, and rapid cadence. We quantify the constraints possible between a sample of 150 such time delay lenses and a near term supernova program, such as might become available from an Antarctic telescope such as the KDUST and the Dark Energy Survey. Adding time delay data to supernovae plus cosmic microwave background information can improve the dark energy figure of merit by almost a factor 5 and determine the matter density Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to 0.004, the Hubble constant h to 0.7\%, and the dark energy equation of state time variation w{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}a{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to 0.26, systematics permitting.},

	abstract = {We present the results of the first strong lens time delay challenge. The motivation, experimental design, and entry level challenge are described in a companion paper. This paper presents the main challenge, TDC1, which consisted of analyzing thousands of simulated light curves blindly. The observational properties of the light curves cover the range in quality obtained for current targeted efforts (e.g., COSMOGRAIL) and expected from future synoptic surveys (e.g., LSST), and include simulated systematic errors. Seven teams participated in TDC1, submitting results from 78 different method variants. After describing each method, we compute and analyze basic statistics measuring accuracy (or bias) A, goodness of fit χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, precision P, and success rate f. For some methods we identify outliers as an important issue. Other methods show that outliers can be controlled via visual inspection or conservative quality control. Several methods are competitive, i.e., give {\textbar}A{\textbar} \&lt; 0.03, P \&lt; 0.03, and χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \&lt; 1.5, with some of the methods already reaching sub-percent accuracy. The fraction of light curves yielding a time delay measurement is typically in the range f = 20\%-40\%. It depends strongly on the quality of the data: COSMOGRAIL-quality cadence and light curve lengths yield significantly higher f than does sparser sampling. Taking the results of TDC1 at face value, we estimate that LSST should provide around 400 robust time-delay measurements, each with P \&lt; 0.03 and {\textbar}A{\textbar} \&lt; 0.01, comparable to current lens modeling uncertainties. In terms of observing strategies, we find that A and f depend mostly on season length, while P depends mostly on cadence and campaign duration.},

	abstract = {We propose a method to remove the mass-sheet degeneracy that arises when the mass of galaxy clusters is inferred from gravitational shear. The method utilizes high-redshift standard candles that undergo weak lensing. Natural candidates for such standard candles are type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). When corrected with the light-curve shape (LCS), the peak magnitude of SNe Ia provides a standard candle with an uncertainty in apparent magnitude of Deltam{\textasciitilde}=0.1-0.2. Gravitational magnification of a background SN Ia by an intervening cluster would cause a mismatch between the observed SN Ia peak magnitude compared with that expected from its LCS and redshift. The average detection rate for SNe Ia with a significant mismatch of \&gt;=2Deltam behind a cluster at z{\textasciitilde}=0.05-0.15 is about 1-2 supernovae per cluster per year at J, I, R\&lt;{\textasciitilde}25-26. Since SNe are point-like sources for a limited period, they can experience significant microlensing by massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) in the intracluster medium. Microlensing events caused by MACHOs of {\textasciitilde}10{\textasciicircum}-4 Msolar are expected to have time-scales similar to that of the SN light curve. Both the magnification curve by a MACHO and the light curve of a SN Ia have characteristic shapes that allow us to separate them. Microlensing events caused by MACHOs of smaller mass can unambiguously be identified in the SN light curve if the latter is continuously monitored. The average number of identifiable microlensing events per nearby cluster (z\&lt;{\textasciitilde}0.05) per year is {\textasciitilde}0.02 (f/0.01), where f is the fraction of the cluster mass in MACHOs of masses 10{\textasciicircum}-7\&lt;M\_macho/Msolar\&lt;10{\textasciicircum}-4.},

	abstract = {With the advent of large, deep surveys, the observation of a strongly gravitationally lensed supernova becomes increasingly likely. High-redshift surveys continue apace, with a handful of Type Ia supernovae observed to date at redshifts of 1 or greater. In addition, a satellite has been proposed (the Supernova/Acceleration Probe [SNAP]) that will be dedicated to observing thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply imaged supernova from ongoing surveys, we find that SNAP would observe at least eight such events per year. Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, SNAP's large sample of Type II supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image separations, and relative image magnifications, and the SNAP strong-lensing database will offer measures of Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, independent of SNAP's primary goal of establishing the distance-redshift relation. These systems also constrain models for the matter density profiles of galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, lensed Type Ia supernovae afford us the opportunity to break the mass-sheet degeneracy found in many lensing measurements.},

Typically, only the most massive subhalos in the strong lensing region may be detected this way. In this work, we show that strong lenses may also be used to constrain the much more numerous population of lower mass subhalos that are too small to be detected individually. In particular, we show that the power spectrum of projected density fluctuations in galaxy halos can be measured using strong gravitational lensing. We develop the mathematical framework of power spectrum estimation, and test our method on mock observations. We use our results to determine the types of observations required to measure the substructure power spectrum with high significance. We predict that deep observations ({\textasciitilde}10 hours on a single target) with current facilities can measure this power spectrum at the 3σ level, with no apparent degeneracy with unknown clumpiness in the background source structure or fluctuations from detector noise. Upcoming ALMA measurements of strong lenses are capable of placing strong constraints on the abundance of dark matter subhalos and the underlying particle nature of dark matter.},

	abstract = {Realizing Refsdal’s original idea from 1964, we present estimates of the Hubble constant that are complementary to, and potentially competitive with, those of other cosmological probes. We use the observed positions of 89 multiple images, with extensive spectroscopic information, from 28 background sources and the measured time delays between the images S1-S4 and SX of supernova “Refsdal” (z = 1.489), which were obtained thanks to Hubble Space Telescope deep imaging and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer data. We extend the strong-lensing modeling of the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.542), published by Grillo et al. (2016), and explore different ΛCDM models. Taking advantage of the lensing information associated to the presence of very close pairs of multiple images at various redshifts, and to the extended surface brightness distribution of the SN Refsdal host, we can reconstruct the total mass-density profile of the cluster very precisely. The combined dependence of the multiple-image positions and time delays on the cosmological parameters allows us to infer the values of H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} with relative (1σ) statistical errors of, respectively, 6\% (7\%) and 31\% (26\%) in flat (general) cosmological models, assuming a conservative 3\% uncertainty on the final time delay of image SX and, remarkably, no priors from other cosmological experiments. Our best estimate of H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, based on the model described in this work, will be presented when the final time-delay measurement becomes available. Our results show that it is possible to utilize time delays in lens galaxy clusters as an important alternative tool for measuring the expansion rate and the geometry of the universe.},

Thanks to a Director's Discretionary Time program with the Very Large Telescope and the extraordinary efficiency of MUSE, we measure 117 secure redshifts with just 4.8 hr of total integration time on a single 1 arcmin{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} target pointing. We spectroscopically confirm 68 galaxy cluster members, with redshift values ranging from 0.5272 to 0.5660, and 18 multiple images belonging to seven background, lensed sources distributed in redshifts between 1.240 and 3.703. Starting from the combination of our catalog with those obtained from extensive spectroscopic and photometric campaigns using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we select a sample of 300 (164 spectroscopic and 136 photometric) cluster members, within approximately 500 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, and a set of 88 reliable multiple images associated with 10 different background source galaxies and 18 distinct knots in the spiral galaxy hosting SN “Refsdal.” We exploit this valuable information to build six detailed strong-lensing models, the best of which reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with an rms offset of only 0.″26. We use these models to quantify the statistical and systematic errors on the predicted values of magnification and time delay of the next emerging image of SN “Refsdal.” We find that its peak luminosity should occur between 2016 March and June and should be approximately 20\% fainter than the dimmest (S4) of the previously detected images but above the detection limit of the planned HST/WFC3 follow-up. We present our two-dimensional reconstruction of the cluster mass density distribution and of the SN “Refsdal” host galaxy surface brightness distribution. We outline the road map toward even better strong-lensing models with a synergetic MUSE and HST effort.

We present a method to achieve this by constraining the probability distribution function of the effective line-of-sight convergence κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The method is based on matching the observed overdensity in the weighted number of galaxies to that found in mock catalogs with κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} obtained by ray-tracing through structure formation simulations. We explore weighting schemes based on projected distance, mass, luminosity, and redshift. This additional information reduces the uncertainty of κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}κ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.06 to {\textasciitilde}0.04 for very overdense LOSs like that of the system B1608+656. For more common LOSs, σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}κ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is reduced to lsim0.03, corresponding to an uncertainty of \&lt;{\textasciitilde} 3\% on distance. This uncertainty has comparable effects on cosmological parameters to that arising from the mass model of the deflector and its immediate environment. Photometric redshifts based on g, r, i and K photometries are sufficient to constrain κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} almost as well as with spectroscopic redshifts. As an illustration, we apply our method to the system B1608+656. Our most reliable κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} estimator gives σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}κ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.047 down from 0.065 using only galaxy counts. Although deeper multiband observations of the field of B1608+656 are necessary to obtain a more precise estimate, we conclude that griK photometry, in addition to spectroscopy to characterize the immediate environment, is an effective way to increase the precision of time-delay cosmography.},

	abstract = {Time delays between the multiple images of strongly gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) have the potential to deliver precise cosmological constraints, but the effects of microlensing on time delay extraction have not been studied in detail. Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the glSN Ia yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the effect of microlensing on the precision and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from LSST glSNe Ia. Microlensing has a negligible effect on the LSST glSN Ia yield, but it can be increased by a factor of ̃2 over previous predictions to 930 systems using a novel photometric identification technique based on spectral template fitting. Crucially, the microlensing of glSNe Ia is achromatic until three rest-frame weeks after the explosion, making the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay indicators. By fitting simulated flux and color observations of microlensed glSNe Ia with their underlying, unlensed spectral templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for LSST, which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color curve observations in the achromatic phase, while for light-curve observations it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties (4\%). About 70\% of LSST glSN Ia images should be discovered during the achromatic phase, indicating that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for microlensing, the 1-2 day time delay on the recently discovered glSN Ia iPTF16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.},

However, only one, iPTF16geu, has been found to date, and many more are needed to achieve these goals. To increase the multiply imaged SN Ia discovery rate, we present a simple algorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates in cadenced, wide-field optical imaging surveys. The technique is to look for supernovae that appear to be hosted by elliptical galaxies, but that have absolute magnitudes implied by the apparent hosts’ photometric redshifts that are far brighter than the absolute magnitudes of normal SNe Ia (the brightest type of supernovae found in elliptical galaxies). Importantly, this purely photometric method does not require the ability to resolve the lensed images for discovery. Active galactic nuclei, the primary sources of contamination that affect the method, can be controlled using catalog cross-matches and color cuts. Highly magnified core-collapse SNe will also be discovered as a byproduct of the method. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we forecast that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope can discover up to 500 multiply imaged SNe Ia using this technique in a 10 year z-band search, more than an order of magnitude improvement over previous estimates. We also predict that the Zwicky Transient Facility should find up to 10 multiply imaged SNe Ia using this technique in a 3 year R-band search—despite the fact that this survey will not resolve a single system.},

We analyze data from a Hubble Space Telescope monitoring project of 12 galaxy clusters at z = 1.13-1.75, where we discover 29 SNe, and present their multiband light curves. Based on the SN photometry and the apparent host galaxies, we assess cluster membership and SN type, finding 11cases that are likely SNe Ia in cluster galaxies and 4 more cases, which are possible but not certain cluster SNe Ia. We conduct simulations to estimate the SN detection efficiency, the experiment's completeness, and the photometric errors, and perform photometry of the cluster galaxies to derive the cluster stellar masses.

We find that lensed images in regions of low convergence, shear and stellar density are standardizable, where the microlensing scatter is ≲ 0.15 mag, comparable to the intrinsic dispersion of a typical SN Ia. These standardizable configurations correspond to asymmetric lenses with an image located far outside the Einstein radius of the lens. Symmetric and small Einstein radius lenses (≲ 0.5 arcsec) are not standardizable. We apply our model to the recently discovered GLSN Ia iPTF16geu and find that the large discrepancy between the observed flux and the macromodel predictions from More et al. cannot be explained by microlensing alone. Using the mock GLSNe Ia catalogue of Goldstein et al., we predict that ̃22 per cent of GLSNe Ia discovered by Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be standardizable, with a median Einstein radius of 0.9 arcsec and a median time delay of 41 d.

The 64 epochs of observation have an average spacing of 3.6 days. The light curves of the four images of the background source show that the flux density of the background source has varied at the {\textasciitilde}5\% level. We measure time delays in the system based on common features that are seen in all four light curves. The three independent time delays in the system are found to be ∆t{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BA{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=31+/-7 days, ∆t{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=36+/-7 days, and ∆t{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BD{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=76{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} days at 95\% confidence.

A fraction of these primordial stars are expected to die as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), and should be bright enough to be observed up to a few hundred million years after the big bang. While the quest for Population III stars continues, detailed theoretical models and computer simulations serve as a testbed for their observability. With the upcoming near-infrared missions, estimates of the feasibility of detecting PISNe are not only timely but imperative.

	abstract = {We present time-delay measurements for the new quadruple imaged quasar DES J0408-5354, the first quadruple imaged quasar found in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). Our result is made possible by implementing a new observational strategy using almost daily observations with the MPIA 2.2 m telescope at La Silla observatory and deep exposures reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. This data qualityallows us to catch small photometric variations (a few mmag rms) of the quasar, acting on temporal scales much shorter than microlensing, and hence making the time delay measurement very robust against microlensing. In only seven months we very accurately measured one of the time delays in DES J0408-5354: ∆t(AB) = -112.1 ± 2.1 days (1.8\%) using only the MPIA 2.2 m data. In combination with data taken with the 1.2 m Euler Swiss telescope, we also measured two delays involving the D component of the system ∆t(AD) = -155.5 ± 12.8 days (8.2\%) and ∆t(BD) = -42.4 ± 17.6 days (41\%), where all the error bars include systematics. Turning these time delays into cosmological constraints will require deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging or ground-based adaptive optics (AO), and information on the velocity field of the lensing galaxy.

	abstract = {The gravitational lens CLASS B1608+656 is the only four-image lens system for which all three independent time delays have been measured. This makes the system an excellent candidate for a high-quality determination of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at cosmological distances. However, the original measurements of the time delays had large (12\%-20\%) uncertainties, due to the low level of variability of the background source during the monitoring campaign. In this paper, we present results from two additional VLA monitoring campaigns. In contrast to the {\textasciitilde}5\% variations seen during the first season of monitoring, the source flux density changed by 25\%-30\% in each of the subsequent two seasons. We analyzed the combined data set from all three seasons of monitoring to improve significantly the precision of the time delay measurements; the delays are consistent with those found in the original measurements, but the uncertainties have decreased by factors of 2-3. We combined the delays with revised isothermal mass models to derive a measurement of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Depending on the positions of the galaxy centroids, which vary by up to 0.1" in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained with different filters, we obtain H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=61-65 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, for (Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater},Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater})=(0.3,0.7). The value of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} decreases by 6\% if (Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}M{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater},Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater})=(1.0,0.0). The formal uncertainties on H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} due to the time-delay measurements are +/-1 (+/-2) km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the 1 σ (2 σ) confidence limits. Thus, the systematic uncertainties due to the lens model, which are on the order of +/-15 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, now dominate the error budget for this system. In order to improve the measurement of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} with this lens, new models that incorporate the constraints provided by stellar dynamics and the optical/infrared Einstein ring seen in HST images must be developed.},

A transformation is presented that leaves unchanged the image observables, including positions, relative magnifications, apparent luminosities, and differences in propagation times associated with image pairs. The observables are related to the parameters of the source and of a generalized lens model. The transformation is applied to these relations to scale the value of H(0) and to modify the mass distribution of the lens and move the position of the source. One lens model for Q0957 + 561 is discussed in the context of this transformation. The elliptical galaxy G1 is modelled as a singular isothermal sphere, and the light bending of the cluster is represented as a linear function of the impact parameter. It is shown that this model accounts for the positions and relative magnifications of images of Q0957 + 561 and yields a bound on H(0).},

It is within one of these images that the first example of a multiply lensed supernova (SN) has been detected recently as part of the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space. The depth of this data also reveals many H II regions within the lensed spiral galaxy which we identify between the five counter-images. Here, we expand the capability of our free-form method to incorporate these H II regions locally, with other reliable lensed galaxies added for a global solution. This improved accuracy allows us to estimate when the Refsdal SN will appear within the other lensed images of the spiral galaxy to an accuracy of ̃7 per cent. We predict this SN will reappear in one of the counter-images (RA = 11:49:36.025, Dec. = +22:23:48.11, J2000) and on 2015 November 1 (with an estimated error of ±25 d) it will be at the same phase as it was when it was originally discovered, offering a unique opportunity to study the early phases of this SN and to examine the consistency of the mass model and the cosmological model that have an impact on the time delay prediction.},

The delays were measured from 575 independent photometric points obtained in the R-band between January 2004 and March 2010. With seven years of data, we clearly show that quasar image A is affected by strong microlensing variations and that the time delays are best expressed relative to quasar image B. We measured ∆t{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BC{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 7.8 ± 0.8 days, ∆t{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BD{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -6.5 ± 0.7 days and ∆t{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}CD{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -14.3 ± 0.8 days. We spacially deconvolved HST NICMOS2 F160W images to derive accurate astrometry of the quasar images and to infer the light profile of the lensing galaxy. We combined these images with a stellar population fitting of a deep VLT spectrum of the lensing galaxy to estimate the baryonic fraction, f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, in the Einstein radius. We measured f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.65{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.13{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} if the lensing galaxy has a Salpeter IMF and f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.45{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.07{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.04{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} if it has a Kroupa IMF. The spectrum also allowed us to estimate the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ap{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 222 ± 34 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We used f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ap{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to constrain an analytical model of the lensing galaxy composed of an Hernquist plus generalized NFW profile. We solved the Jeans equations numerically for the model and explored the parameter space under the additional requirement that the model must predict the correct astrometry for the quasar images. Given the current error bars on f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ap{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, we did not constrain H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yet with high accuracy, i.e., we found a broad range of models with χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \&lt; 1. However, narrowing this range is possible, provided a better velocity dispersion measurement becomes available. In addition, increasing the depth of the current HST imaging data of HE 0435-1223 will allow us to combine ourconstraints with lens reconstruction techniques that make use of the full Einstein ring that is visible in this object.

	abstract = {Inferring cosmological parameters from time-delay strong lenses requires a significant investment of telescope time; it is therefore tempting to focus on the systems with the brightest sources, the highest image multiplicities and the widest image separations. We investigate if this selection bias can influence the properties of the lenses studied and the cosmological parameters inferred. Using an ellipsoidal power-law deflector population, we build a sample of double- and quadruple-image systems. Assuming reasonable thresholds on image separation and flux, based on current lens monitoring campaigns, we find that the typical density profile slopes of monitorable lenses are significantly shallower than the input ensemble. From a sample of quads, we find that this selection function can introduce a 3.5 per cent bias on the inferred time-delay distances if the properties of the input ensemble are (incorrectly) used as priors on the lens model. This bias remains at the 2.4 per cent level when high-resolution imaging of the quasar host is used to precisely infer the properties of individual lenses. We also investigate if the lines of sight for monitorable strong lenses are biased. The expectation value for the line-of-sight convergence is increased by 0.009 (0.004) for quads (doubles) implying a 0.9 per cent (0.4 per cent) bias on H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We therefore conclude that whilst the properties of typical quasar lenses and their lines of sight do deviate from the global population, the total magnitude of this effect is likely to be a subdominant effect for current analyses, but has the potential to be a major systematic for samples of ̃25 or more lenses.},

Similar constraints could be obtained by a dedicated gravitational lens observatory (OMEGA) which would obtain precise TD and mass model measurements for {\textasciitilde}100 well-studied lenses. We compare these constraints (as well as those for a more general cosmology) to the "optimistic Stage IV" constraints expected from weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cluster counts, as calculated by the Dark Energy Task Force. TDs yield a modest constraint on a time-varying w(z), with the best constraint on w(z) at the "pivot redshift" of z ≈ 0.31. Our Fisher matrix calculation is provided to allow TD constraints to be easily compared to and combined with constraints from other experiments. We also show how cosmological constraining power varies as a function of numbers of lenses, lens model uncertainty, TD precision, redshift precision, and the ratio of four-image to two-image lenses.},

In this work, we aim to present the first attempt at modelling line-of-sight (LOS) mass distribution in addition to that of the cluster, extending previous modelling techniques that assume mass distributions to be on a single lens plane. We have focussed on the Hubble Frontier Field cluster MACS J0416.1-2403, and our multi-plane model reproduces the observed image positions with a rms offset of 0.''53. Starting from this best-fitting model, we simulated a mock cluster that resembles MACS J0416.1-2403 in order to explore the effects of LOS structures on cluster mass modelling. By systematically analysing the mock cluster under different model assumptions, we find that neglecting the lensing environment has a significant impact on the reconstruction of image positions (rms 0.''3); accounting for LOS galaxies as if they were at the cluster redshift can partially reduce this offset. Moreover, foreground galaxies are more important to include into the model than the background ones. While the magnification factor of the lensed multiple images are recovered within 10\% for 95\% of them, those 5\% that lie near critical curves can be significantly affected by the exclusion of the lensing environment in the models. In addition, LOS galaxies cannot explain the apparent discrepancy in the properties of massive sub-halos between MACS J0416.1-2403 and N-body simulated clusters. Since our model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with LOS galaxies only reduced modestly the rms offset in the image positions, we conclude that additional complexities would be needed in future models of MACS J0416.1-2403.},

With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, each strong gravitational lens system with measured time delays can allow one to determine the Hubble constant with an uncertainty of ̃7 per cent. Since HST will not last forever, we explore adaptive-optics (AO) imaging as an alternative that can provide higher angular resolution than HST imaging but has a less stable point spread function (PSF) due to atmospheric distortion. To make AO imaging useful for time-delay-lens cosmography, we develop a method to extract the unknown PSF directly from the imaging of strongly lensed quasars. In a blind test with two mock data sets created with different PSFs, we are able to recover the important cosmological parameters (time-delay distance, external shear, lens-mass profile slope, and total Einstein radius). Our analysis of the Keck AO image of the strong lens system RXJ 1131-1231 shows that the important parameters for cosmography agree with those based on HST imaging and modelling within 1σ uncertainties. Most importantly, the constraint on the model time-delay distance by using AO imaging with 0.09 arcsec resolution is tighter by ̃50 per cent than the constraint of time-delay distance by using HST imaging with 0.09 arcsec when a power-law mass distribution for the lens system is adopted. Our PSF reconstruction technique is generic and applicable to data sets that have multiple nearby point sources, enabling scientific studies that require high-precision models of the PSF.},

The precision of the H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurement depends on the uncertainties in the time-delay measurements, the mass distribution of the main deflector(s), and the mass distribution along the line of sight. Tie \&amp; Kochanek have proposed a new microlensing effect on time delays based on differential magnification of the coherent accretion disc variability of the lensed quasar. If real, this effect could significantly broaden the uncertainty on the time-delay measurements by up to 30 per cent for lens systems such as PG 1115+080, which have relatively short time delays and monitoring over several different epochs. In this paper we develop a new technique that uses the cosmological time-delay ratios and simulated microlensing maps within a Bayesian framework in order to limit the allowed combinations of microlensing delays and thus to lessen the uncertainties due to the proposed effect. We show that, under the assumption of Tie \&amp; Kochanek, the uncertainty on the time-delay distance (D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, which is proportional to 1/H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of the short time-delay (̃18 d) lens, PG 1115+080, increases from ̃7 per cent to ̃10 per cent by simultaneously fitting the three time-delay measurements from the three different data sets across 20 yr, while in the case of the long time-delay (̃90 d) lens, the microlensing effect on time delays is negligible as the uncertainty on D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} of RXJ 1131-1231 only increases from ̃2.5 per cent to ̃2.6 per cent.},

	abstract = {The spectacular success of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in SN-cosmology is based on the assumption that their photometric and spectroscopic properties are invariant with redshift. However, this fundamental assumption needs to be tested with observations of high-z SNe Ia. To date, the majority of SNe Ia observed at moderate to large redshifts (0.4 ≤ z ≤ 1.0) are faint, and the resultant analyses are based on observations with modest signal-to-noise ratios that impart a degree of ambiguity in their determined properties. In rare cases, however, the Universe offers a helping hand: To date a few SNe Ia have been observed that have had their luminosities magnified by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses. In this paper, we present long-slit spectroscopy of the lensed SN Ia 2016geu, which occurred at a redshift of z = 0.409, and was magnified by a factor of ≈55 by a galaxy located at z = 0.216. We compared our spectra, which were obtained a couple of weeks to a couple of months past peak light, with the spectroscopic properties of well-observed, nearby SNe Ia, finding that SN 2016geu's properties are commensurate with those of SNe Ia in the local Universe. Based primarily on the velocity and strength of the Si II λ6355 absorption feature, we find that SN 2016geu can be classified as a high-velocity, high-velocity-gradient and 'core-normal' SN Ia. The strength of various features (measured though their pseudo-equivalent widths) argue against SN 2016geu being a faint, broad-lined, cool or shallow-silicon SN Ia. We conclude that the spectroscopic properties of SN 2016geu imply that it is a normal SN Ia, and when taking previous results by other authors into consideration, there is very little, if any, evolution in the observational properties of SNe Ia up to z ≈ 0.4.},

	abstract = {We present time-delay estimates for the quadruply imaged quasar PG 1115+080. Our results are based on almost daily observations for seven months at the ESO MPIA 2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. In addition, we re-analyze existing light curves from the literature that we complete with an additional three seasons of monitoring with the Mercator telescope at La Palma Observatory. When exploring the possible source of bias we considered the so-called microlensing time delay, a potential source of systematic error so far never directly accounted for in previous time-delay publications. In 15 yr of data on PG 1115+080, we find no strong evidence of microlensing time delay. Therefore not accounting for this effect, our time-delay estimates on the individual data sets are in good agreement with each other and with the literature. Combining the data sets, we obtain the most precise time-delay estimates to date on PG 1115+080, with ∆t(AB) = 8.3{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-1.6{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} days (18.7\% precision), ∆t(AC) = 9.9{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-1.1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} days (11.1\%) and ∆t(BC) = 18.8{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+1.6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-1.6{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} days (8.5\%).

	abstract = {COSMOGRAIL is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed quasars aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological parameters, in particular H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Given the long and well sampled light curves of strongly lensed quasars, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques whose quality must be assessed. To this end, and also in view of future monitoring programs or surveys such as the LSST, a blind signal processing competition named Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) was held in 2014. The aim of the present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1, is double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement techniques currently used in COSMOGRAIL. Second, we analyse the quantity and quality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the TDC1 simulations. To achieve these goals, we first discover time delays through a careful inspection of the light curves via a dedicated visual interface. Our measurement algorithms can then be applied to the data in an automated way. We show that our techniques have no significant biases, and yield adequate uncertainty estimates resulting in reduced χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} values between 0.5 and 1.0. We provide estimates for the number and precision of time-delay measurements that can be expected from future time-delay monitoring campaigns as a function of the photometric signal-to-noise ratio and of the true time delay. We make our blind measurements on the TDC1 data publicly available.},

	abstract = {We present extended modelling of the strong lens system RXJ1131-1231 with archival data in two HST bands in combination with existing line-of-sight contribution and velocity dispersion estimates. Our focus is on source size and its influence on time-delay cosmography. We therefore examine the impact of mass-sheet degeneracy and especially the degeneracy pointed out by Schneider \&amp; Sluse (2013) [1] using the source reconstruction scale. We also extend on previous work by further exploring the effects of priors on the kinematics of the lens and the external convergence in the environment of the lensing system. Our results coming from RXJ1131-1231 are given in a simple analytic form so that they can be easily combined with constraints coming from other cosmological probes. We find that the choice of priors on lens model parameters and source size are subdominant for the statistical errors for H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurements of this systems. The choice of prior for the source is sub-dominant at present (2\% uncertainty on H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) but may be relevant for future studies. More importantly, we find that the priors on the kinematic anisotropy of the lens galaxy have a significant impact on our cosmological inference. When incorporating all the above modeling uncertainties, we find H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 86.6{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+6.8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-6.9{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, when using kinematic priors similar to other studies. When we use a different kinematic prior motivated by Barnabè et al. (2012) [2] but covering the same anisotropic range, we find H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 74.5{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+8.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-7.8{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. This means that the choice of kinematic modeling and priors have a significant impact on cosmographic inferences. The way forward is either to get better velocity dispersion measures which would down weight the impact of the priors or to construct physically motivated priors for the velocity dispersion model.},

This represents a factor of ≈5 ± 2 increase over measurements of the cluster rate at z \&lt; 0.2.

Under the approximation of a single-burst cluster formation redshift of z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}f{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3, our rate measurement in combination with lower-redshift cluster SN Ia rates constrains s = -1.41{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.47{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.40{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, consistent with measurements of the DTD in the field. This measurement is generally consistent with expectations for the "double degenerate" scenario and inconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting a steeper DTD at large delay times. We check for environmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations by calculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and in morphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the full cluster rate. Finally, the upper limit of one hostless cluster SN Ia detected in the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium is less than 0.47 (95\% confidence), consistent with measurements at lower redshifts.

We identify promising color trends that may permit the identification of stripped-envelope SN subtypes from their photometry alone. Many of these SNe were observed spectroscopically by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) SN group, and the spectra are presented in a companion paper. A thorough exploration that combines the CfA photometry and spectroscopy of stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe will be presented in a follow-up paper.},

We combine the relative time delay between the quasar images, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, the Keck stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, and wide-field photometric and spectroscopic data of the field to constrain two angular diameter distance relations. The combined analysis is performed by forward modelling the individual data sets through a Bayesian hierarchical framework, and it is kept blind until the very end to prevent experimenter bias. After unblinding, the inferred distances imply a Hubble constant H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 68.8{\textasciicircum}\{+5.4\}\_\{-5.1\} km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, assuming a flat Λ cold dark matter cosmology with uniform prior on Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in [0.05, 0.5]. The precision of our cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 is comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads. Our analysis is based on a completely independent lensing code than our previous three H0LiCOW systems and the new measurement is fully consistent with those. We provide the analysis scripts paired with the publicly available software to facilitate independent analysis (footnote with link to www.h0licow.org). The consistency between blind measurements with independent codes provides an important sanity check on lens modelling systematics.

First, we measure the time delay of HE 0435-1223 from 13-yr light curves obtained as part of the COSMOGRAIL project. Companion papers detail the modelling of the main deflectors and line-of-sight effects, and how these data are combined to determine the time-delay distance of HE 0435-1223. Crucially, the measurements are carried out blindly with respect to cosmological parameters in order to avoid confirmation bias. We then combine the time-delay distance of HE 0435-1223 with previous measurements from systems B1608+656 and RXJ1131-1231 to create a Time Delay Strong Lensing probe (TDSL).

	abstract = {It has recently been proposed that gravitationally lensed type-Ia supernovae can provide microlensing-free time-delay measurements provided that the measurement is taken during the achromatic expansion phase of the explosion and that color light curves are used rather than single-band light curves. If verified, this would provide both precise and accurate time-delay measurements, making lensed type-Ia supernovae a new golden standard for time-delay cosmography. However, the 3D geometry of the expanding shell can introduce an additional bias that has not yet been fully explored. In this work, we present and discuss the impact of this effect on time-delay cosmography with lensed supernovae and find that on average it leads to a bias of a few tenths of a day for individual lensed systems. This is negligible in view of the cosmological time delays predicted for typical lensed type-Ia supernovae but not for the specific case of the recently discovered type-Ia supernova iPTF16geu, whose time delays are expected to be smaller than a day.},

	abstract = {This paper presents optical R-band light curves and the time delay of the doubly imaged gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1001+5027 at a redshift of 1.838. We have observed this target for more than six years, between March 2005 and July 2011, using the 1.2-m Mercator Telescope, the 1.5-m telescope of the Maidanak Observatory, and the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our resulting light curves are composed of 443 independent epochs, and show strong intrinsic quasar variability, with an amplitude of the order of 0.2 magnitudes. From this data, we measure the time delay using five different methods, all relying on distinct approaches. One of these techniques is a new development presented in this paper. All our time-delay measurements are perfectly compatible. By combining them, we conclude that image A is leading B by 119.3 ± 3.3 days (1σ, 2.8\% uncertainty), including systematic errors. It has been shown recently that such accurate time-delay measurements offer a highly complementary probe of dark energy and spatial curvature, as they independently constrain the Hubble constant. The next mandatory step towards using SDSS J1001+5027 in this context will be the measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, in combination with deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging.

Recently, a supernova was found to shine much brighter than normal for its distance, which resulted in a debate: Was it a new type of superluminous supernova or a normal SNIa magnified by a hidden gravitational lens? Here, we report that a spectrum obtained after the supernova faded away shows the presence of a foreground galaxy—the first found to strongly magnify a SNIa. We discuss how more lensed SNIa can be found than previously predicted.},

The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The CLASH cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 CLASH clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive (kT \&gt; 5 keV) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (θ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Ein{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 35'' at z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 2) to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z \&gt; 7) galaxies.

The observations were obtained at ̃6 month intervals over 4 years. The distances are 1.7-3.6 kpc, with a mean precision of 45 μas (signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≈ 10) and a best precision of 29 μas (S/N = 14). The accuracy of the parallaxes is demonstrated through independent analyses of \&gt;100 reference stars. This raises to 10 the number of long-period Cepheids with significant parallax measurements, 8 obtained from this program. We also present high-precision mean F555W, F814W, and F160W magnitudes of these Cepheids, allowing a direct, zeropoint-independent comparison to \&gt;1800 extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of 19 SNe Ia. This sample addresses two outstanding systematic uncertainties affecting prior comparisons of MW and extragalactic Cepheids used to calibrate the Hubble constant (H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}): their dissimilarity of periods and photometric systems. Comparing the new parallaxes to their predicted values derived from reversing the distance ladder gives a ratio (or independent scale for H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of 1.037 ± 0.036, consistent with no change and inconsistent at the 3.5σ level with a ratio of 0.91 needed to match the value predicted by Planck cosmic microwave background data in concert with ΛCDM. Using these data instead to augment the Riess et al. measurement of H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} improves the precision to 2.3\%, yielding 73.48 ± 1.66 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and the tension with Planck + ΛCDM increases to 3.7σ.

We measure the under/overdensity of the line of sight towards the lens system and compare it to the average line of sight throughout the Universe, determined by using the CFHTLenS (The Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey) as a control field. Aiming to constrain κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} as tightly as possible, we determine under/overdensities using various combinations of relevant informative weighting schemes for the galaxy counts, such as projected distance to the lens, redshift and stellar mass. We then convert the measured under/overdensities into a κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} distribution, using ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation. We explore several limiting magnitudes and apertures, and account for systematic and statistical uncertainties relevant to the quality of the observational data, which we further test through simulations.

	abstract = {The time-delay in gravitational lenses can be used to derive the Hubble constant in a relatively simple way. The results of this method are less dependent on astrophysical assumptions than in many other methods. For systems with accurately measured positions and time-delays, the most important uncertainty is related to the mass model used. Simple parametric models like isothermal ellipsoidal mass distributions seem to provide consistent results with a reasonably small scatter when applied to several lens systems. We discuss a family of models with a separable radial power law and an arbitrary angular dependence for the potential ψ=r{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}β{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}F(θ). Isothermal potentials are a special case of these models with β=1. An additional external shear is used to take into account perturbations from other galaxies. Using a simple linear formalism for quadruple lenses, we can derive H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} as a function of the observables and the shear. If the latter is fixed, the result depends on the assumed power-law exponent according to H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}(2-β)/β. The effect of external shear is quantified by introducing a `critical shear' γ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} as a measure for the amount of shear that changes the result significantly. The analysis shows that in the general case H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and γ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} do not depend on the position of the lens galaxy. Spherical lens models with images close to the Einstein radius with fitted external shear differ by a factor of β/2 from shearless models, leading to H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2-β in this case. We discuss these results and compare them with numerical models for a number of real lens systems.},

	abstract = {A power-law density model, I.e. ρ (r) ∝ r{\textasciicircum}\{-γ {\textasciicircum}' \vphantom{\{}\}\}, has been commonly employed in strong gravitational lensing studies, including the so-called time-delay technique used to infer the Hubble constant H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. However, since the radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonic matter to dark matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow a power law in density. The assumption of a power law artificially breaks the mass-sheet degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitational lensing which affects the product of Hubble constant and time delay and can therefore cause a bias in the determination of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from the time-delay technique. In this paper, we use the Illustris hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related to observational properties of galaxies. Investigating a large sample of Illustris galaxies that have velocity dispersion σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}SIE{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≥ 160 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at redshifts below z = 1, we find that the bias on H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} introduced by the power-law assumption can reach 20-50 per cent, with a scatter of 10-30 per cent (rms). However, we find that by selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law model slope close to isothermal, it is possible to reduce the bias on H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to ≲ 5 per cent and the scatter to ≲ 10 per cent. This could potentially be used to form less biased statistical samples for H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurements in the upcoming large survey era.},

	abstract = {Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) can be detected as multiply imaged or highly magnified transients. In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of SNe (types Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc, and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST (Large Synoptic Sky Survey) surveys. For survey depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed SNe. SN samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed SNe detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged SN still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed SNe found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification. We provide useful fitting functions approximating the computed discovery rates for different SN classes and detection methods. We find that the Zwicky Transient Factory will find about two type Ia and four core-collapse lensed SNe per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed SNe per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed SNe will be dominated by type IIn SNe contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of SNe. Revisiting the case of the lensed SN iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2σ contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory survey.},

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing provides an independent measurement of the Hubble parameter (H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). One remaining systematic is a bias from the additional mass due to a galaxy group at the lens redshift or along the sightline. We quantify this bias for more than 20 strong lenses that have well-sampled sightline mass distributions, focusing on the convergence κ and shear γ. In 23\% of these fields, a lens group contributes ≥1\% convergence bias; in 57\%, there is a similarly significant line-of-sight group. For the nine time-delay lens systems, H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is overestimated by \{11\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\% on average when groups are ignored. In 67\% of fields with total κ ≥slant 0.01, line-of-sight groups contribute ≳ 2× more convergence than do lens groups, indicating that the lens group is not the only important mass. Lens environment affects the ratio of four (quad) to two (double) image systems; all seven quads have lens groups while only 3 of 10 doubles do, and the highest convergences due to lens groups are in quads. We calibrate the γ-κ relation: \{log\}(\{κ \}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{tot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\})=(1.94+/- 0.34)\{log\}(\{γ \}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{tot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}) +(1.31+/- 0.49) with an rms scatter of 0.34 dex. Although shear can be measured directly from lensed images, unlike convergence, it can be a poor predictor of convergence; for 19\% of our fields, κ is ≳ 2γ . Thus, accurate cosmology using strong gravitational lenses requires precise measurement and correction for all significant structures in each lens field.},

MACS J1149, which lenses SN Refsdal into a quad S1-S4, and two other widely separated images, SX and SY, is a perfect candidate. If time delays are pinned down, the remaining uncertainty arises from the mass distribution in the lens. In MACS J1149, the mass in the relevant lens plane region can be constrained by (i) many multiple images, (ii) the mass of the galaxy splitting S1-S4 (which, we show, is correlated with H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), (iii) magnification of SX (also correlated with H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), and (iv) prior assumptions on the mass distribution. Our goal is not to estimate H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, but to understand its error budget, i.e. estimate uncertainties associated with each of these constraints. Using multiple image positions alone yields very large uncertainty, despite the fact that the position of SX is recovered to within ≤0.036 arcsec (rms ≤ 0.36 arcsec) by GRALE lens inversion. Fixing the mass of the galaxy that splits S1-S4 reduces 1σ uncertainties to \{̃ \} 23\{\{ per cent\}\}, while fixing the magnification of SX yields 1σ uncertainties of 32\{\{ per cent\}\}. We conclude that smaller uncertainties, of order few per cent, are a consequence of imposing prior assumptions on the shapes of the galaxy and cluster mass distributions, which may or may not apply in a highly non-equilibrium environment of a merging cluster. We propose that if a measurement of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is to be considered reliable, it must be supported by a wide range of lens inversion methods.},

	abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein’s theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage IV” dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

	abstract = {JWST was conceived and built to answer one of the most fundamental questions that humans can address empirically: "How did the Universe make its first stars?". Our First Lights At REionization (FLARE) project transforms the quest for the epoch of reionization from the static to the time domain. It targets the complementary question: "What happened to those first stars?". It will be answered by observations of the most luminous events: supernovae and accretion on to black holes formed by direct collapse from the primordial gas clouds. These transients provide direct constraints on star-formation rates (SFRs) and the truly initial Initial Mass Function (IMF), and they may identify possible stellar seeds of supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Furthermore, our knowledge of the physics of these events at ultra-low metallicity will be much expanded. JWST's unique capabilities will detect these most luminous and earliest cosmic messengers easily in fairly shallow observations. However, these events are very rare at the dawn of cosmic structure formation and so require large area coverage. Time domain astronomy can be advanced to an unprecedented depth by means of a shallow field of JWST reaching 27 mag AB in 2 and 4.4 microns over a field as large as 0.1 square degree visited multiple times each year. Such a survey may set strong constraints or detect massive Pop III SNe at redshifts beyond 10, pinpointing the redshift of the first stars, or at least their death. Based on our current knowledge of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), such a survey will find one or more SLSNe at redshifts above 6 in five years and possibly several direct collapse black holes. Although JWST is not designed as a wide field survey telescope, we show that such a wide field survey is possible with JWST and is critical in addressing several of its key scientific goals.},

The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) yields near-infrared spectra of the cluster cores covering the wavelength range 0.81-1.69 μm through grisms G102 and G141, while the Advanced Camera for Surveys in parallel mode provides G800L spectra of the infall regions of the clusters.

In order to take advantage of this event, we produced seven gravitational lens models with five independent methods, based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Hubble Frontier Field images, along with extensive spectroscopic follow-up observations by HST, the Very Large and the Keck Telescopes. We compare the model predictions and show that they agree reasonably well with the measured time delays and magnification ratios between the known images, even though these quantities were not used as input. This agreement is encouraging, considering that the models only provide statistical uncertainties, and do not include additional sources of uncertainties such as structure along the line of sight, cosmology, and the mass sheet degeneracy. We then present the model predictions for the other appearances of supernova “Refsdal.” A future image will reach its peak in the first half of 2016, while another image appeared between 1994 and 2004. The past image would have been too faint to be detected in existing archival images. The future image should be approximately one-third as bright as the brightest known image (I.e., \{H\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{AB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\}≈ 25.7 mag at peak and \{H\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{AB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\}≈ 26.7 mag six months before peak), and thus detectable in single-orbit HST images.

Our results, consistent with previous studies of this lens, confirm that the intervening mass along the line of sight to HE 0435-1223 does not affect significantly the cosmological results inferred from the time-delay measurements of that specific object.},

	abstract = {The time delays of gravitationally lensed quasars are generally believed to be unique numbers whose measurement is limited only by the quality of the light curves and the models for the contaminating contribution of gravitational microlensing to the light curves. This belief is incorrect - gravitational microlensing also produces changes in the actual time delays on the ̃day(s) light-crossing time-scale of the emission region. This is due to a combination of the inclination of the disc relative to the line of sight and the differential magnification of the temperature fluctuations producing the variability. We demonstrate this both mathematically and with direct calculations using microlensing magnification patterns. Measuring these delay fluctuations can provide a physical scale for microlensing observations, removing the need for priors on either the microlens masses or the component velocities. That time delays in lensed quasars are themselves time variable likely explains why repeated delay measurements of individual lensed quasars appear to vary by more than their estimated uncertainties. This effect is also a new important systematic problem for attempts to use time delays in lensed quasars for cosmology or to detect substructures (satellites) in lens galaxies.},

The R-band light curves of the four individual images of the quasar were obtained using deconvolution photometry for a total of 707 epochs. Several sharp quasar variability features strongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. Using three different numerical techniques, we measured these delays for all possible pairs of quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously. For all three methods, the delays between the three close images A, B, and C are compatible with being 0, while we measured the delay of image D to be 91 days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5\% (1σ), including systematic errors. Our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realistic way for the observed quasar variability, fluctuating microlensing magnification over a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps.

This requires long and well sampled optical light curves of numerous lensed quasars, such as those obtained by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration. High-quality data from our monitoring campaign call for novel numerical techniques to robustly measure the delays, as well as the associated random and systematic uncertainties, even in the presence of microlensing variations. We propose three different point estimators to measure time delays, which are explicitly designed to handle light curves with extrinsic variability. These methods share a common formalism, which enables them to process data from n-image lenses. Since the estimators rely on significantly contrasting ideas, we expect them to be sensitive to different bias sources. For each method and data set, we empirically estimate both the precision and accuracy (bias) of the time delay measurement using simulated light curves with known time delays that closely mimic the observations. Finally, we test the self-consistency of our approach, and we demonstrate that our bias estimation is serviceable. These new methods, including the empirical uncertainty estimator, will represent the standard benchmark for analyzing the COSMOGRAIL light curves.},

	abstract = {Under the assumption of a flat ΛCDM cosmology, recent data from the Planck satellite point toward a Hubble constant that is in tension with that measured by gravitational lens time delays and by the local distance ladder. Prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic uncertainties in some of the measurements. More interestingly—if systematics were ruled out—resolving the tension would require a departure from the flat ΛCDM cosmology, introducing, for example, a modest amount of spatial curvature, or a non-trivial dark energy equation of state. To begin to address these issues, we present an analysis of the gravitational lens RXJ1131-1231 that is improved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic error introduced by an assumed lens model density profile. We use more flexible gravitational lens models with baryonic and dark matter components, and find that the exquisite Hubble Space Telescope image with thousands of intensity pixels in the Einstein ring and the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens contain sufficient information to constrain these more flexible models. The total uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.6\% for a single system. We proceed to combine our improved time-delay distance measurement with the WMAP9 and Planck posteriors.

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 ± 15 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens' environment. Our analysis of the HST images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope γ' and the external convergence κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density profile logarithmic slope to be γ' = 2.08 ± 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field provides an estimate of the prior for κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}: 0.10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.08{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.05{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. This latter distribution dominates the final uncertainty on H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Fixing the cosmological parameters at Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.3, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.7, and w = -1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we find H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 70.6{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+3.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-3.1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over κ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year data set, we find that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at w = -1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 \&lt; Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}k{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.009 (95\% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in combination with WMAP, H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 69.7{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+4.9{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-5.0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and w = -0.94{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.17{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.19{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (68\% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do.

Our blind analysis is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The joint analysis of the data sets allows a time-delay distance measurement to 6\% precision that takes into account all known systematic uncertainties. In combination with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven-year (WMAP7) data set in flat wCDM cosmology, our unblinded cosmological constraints for RXJ1131-1231 are H\_0=80.0{\textasciicircum}\{+5.8\}\_\{-5.7\} km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}de{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.79 ± 0.03, and w=-1.25{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.21\}.

Time-delay lenses constrain especially tightly the Hubble constant H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (5.7\% and 4.0\% respectively in wCDM and open ΛCDM) and curvature of the universe. The overall information content is similar to that of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation experiments. Thus, they complement well other cosmological probes, and provide an independent check of unknown systematics. Our measurement of the Hubble constant is completely independent of those based on the local distance ladder method, providing an important consistency check of the standard cosmological model and of general relativity.},

	abstract = {The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Project Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality mirror assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The option of adding an on-axis, coronagraphic instrument would enable imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars. This document presents the final report of the SDT.},

	abstract = {Strongly gravitational lensed quasars can be used to measure the so-called time-delay distance D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and thus the Hubble constant H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and other cosmological parameters. Stellar kinematics of the deflector galaxy play an essential role in this measurement by: (i) helping break the mass-sheet degeneracy; (ii) determining in principle the angular diameter distance D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to the deflector and thus further improving the cosmological constraints. In this paper we simulate observations of lensed quasars with integral field spectrographs and show that spatially resolved kinematics of the deflector enables further progress by helping break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. Furthermore, we use our simulations to obtain realistic error estimates with current/upcoming instruments like OSIRIS on Keck and NIRSPEC on the James Webb Space Telescope for both distances (typically ̃6 per cent on D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and ̃10 per cent on D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). We use the error estimates to compute cosmological forecasts for the sample of nine lenses that currently have well-measured time delays and deep Hubble Space Telescope images and for a sample of 40 lenses that is projected to be available in a few years through follow-up of candidates found in ongoing wide field surveys. We find that H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} can be measured with 2 per cent (1 per cent) precision from nine (40) lenses in a flat Λcold dark matter cosmology. We study several other cosmological models beyond the flat Λcold dark matter model and find that time-delay lenses with spatially resolved kinematics can greatly improve the precision of the cosmological parameters measured by cosmic microwave background data.},

	abstract = {Galaxies located in the environment or along the line of sight towards gravitational lenses can significantly affect lensing observables, and can lead to systematic errors on the measurement of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from the time-delay technique. We present the results of a systematic spectroscopic identification of the galaxies in the field of view of the lensed quasar HE 0435-1223 using the W. M. Keck, Gemini and ESO-Very Large telescopes. Our new catalogue triples the number of known galaxy redshifts in the direct vicinity of the lens, expanding to 102 the number of measured redshifts for galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin from the lens. We complement our catalogue with literature data to gather redshifts up to 15 arcmin from the lens, and search for galaxy groups or clusters projected towards HE 0435-1223. We confirm that the lens is a member of a small group that includes at least 12 galaxies, and find 8 other group candidates near the line of sight of the lens. The flexion shift, namely the shift of lensed images produced by high-order perturbation of the lens potential, is calculated for each galaxy/group and used to identify which objects produce the largest perturbation of the lens potential. This analysis demonstrates that (I) at most three of the five brightest galaxies projected within 12 arcsec of the lens need to be explicitly used in the lens models, and (II) the groups can be treated in the lens model as an external tidal field (shear) contribution.},

	abstract = {We present the full sample of 118 galaxy-scale strong-lens candidates in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey for the Masses (S4TM) Survey, which are spectroscopically selected from the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations confirm that 40 candidates are definite strong lenses with multiple lensed images. The foreground-lens galaxies are found to be early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts 0.06-0.44, and background sources are emission-line galaxies at redshifts 0.22-1.29. As an extension of the SLACS Survey, the S4TM Survey is the first attempt to preferentially search for strong-lens systems with relatively lower lens masses than those in the pre-existing strong-lens samples. By fitting HST data with a singular isothermal ellipsoid model, we find that the total projected mass within the Einstein radius of the S4TM strong-lens sample ranges from 3 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to 2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. In Shu et al., we have derived the total stellar mass of the S4TM lenses to be 5 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to 1 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}12{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Both the total enclosed mass and stellar mass of the S4TM lenses are on average almost a factor of 2 smaller than those of the SLACS lenses, which also represent the typical mass scales of the current strong-lens samples. The extended mass coverage provided by the S4TM sample can enable a direct test, with the aid of strong lensing, for transitions in scaling relations, kinematic properties, mass structure, and dark-matter content trends of ETGs at intermediate-mass scales as noted in previous studies.

	abstract = {We propose a new strategy of finding strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) by monitoring known galaxy-scale strong-lens systems. Strongly lensed SNe are potentially powerful tools for the study of cosmology, galaxy evolution, and stellar populations, but they are extremely rare. By targeting known strongly lensed star-forming galaxies, our strategy significantly boosts the detection efficiency for lensed SNe compared to a blind search. As a reference sample, we compile the 128 galaxy-galaxy strong-lens systems from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS), the SLACS for the Masses Survey, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Emission-Line Lens Survey. Within this sample, we estimate the rates of strongly lensed Type Ia SN (SNIa) and core-collapse SN (CCSN) to be 1.23 ± 0.12 and 10.4 ± 1.1 events per year, respectively. The lensed SN images are expected to be widely separated with a median separation of 2 arcsec. Assuming a conservative fiducial lensing magnification factor of 5 for the most highly magnified SN image, we forecast that a monitoring program with a single-visit depth of 24.7 mag (5σ point source, r band) and a cadence of 5 days can detect 0.49 strongly lensed SNIa event and 2.1 strongly lensed CCSN events per year within this sample. Our proposed targeted-search strategy is particularly useful for prompt and efficient identifications and follow-up observations of strongly lensed SN candidates. It also allows telescopes with small fields of view and limited time to efficiently discover strongly lensed SNe with a pencil-beam scanning strategy.},

	abstract = {The main obstacle that gravitational lensing has in determining accurate masses of deflectors, or in determining precise estimates for the Hubble constant, is the degeneracy of lensing observables with respect to the mass-sheet transformation (MST). The MST is a global modification of the mass distribution which leaves all image positions, shapes, and flux ratios invariant, but which changes the time delay. Here we show that another global transformation of lensing mass distributions exists which leaves image positions and flux ratios almost invariant, and of which the MST is a special case. As is the case for the MST, this new transformation only applies if one considers only those source components that are at the same distance from us. Whereas for axi-symmetric lenses this source position transformation exactly reproduces all strong lensing observables, it does so only approximately for more general lens situations. We provide crude estimates for the accuracy with which the transformed mass distribution can reproduce the same image positions as the original lens model, and present an illustrative example of its performance. This new invariance transformation is most likely the reason why the same strong lensing information can be accounted for with rather different mass models.},

	abstract = {The light travel time differences in strong gravitational lensing systems allows an independent determination of the Hubble constant. This method has been successfully applied to several lens systems. The formally most precise measurements are, however, in tension with the recent determination of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from the Planck satellite for a spatially flat six-parameters ΛCDM cosmology. We reconsider the uncertainties of the method, concerning the mass profile of the lens galaxies, and show that the formal precision relies on the assumption that the mass profile is a perfect power law. Simple analytical arguments and numerical experiments reveal that mass-sheet like transformations yield significant freedom in choosing the mass profile, even when exquisite Einstein rings are observed. Furthermore, the characterization of the environment of the lens does not break that degeneracy which is not physically linked to extrinsic convergence. We present an illustrative example where the multiple imaging properties of a composite (baryons + dark matter) lens can be extremely well reproduced by a power-law model having the same velocity dispersion, but with predictions for the Hubble constant that deviate by {\textasciitilde}20\%. Hence we conclude that the impact of degeneracies between parametrized models have been underestimated in current H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurements from lensing, and need to be carefully reconsidered.},

The first four observed images of SN Refsdal (images S1-S4) exhibited a slow rise (over ̃150 days) to reach a broad peak brightness around 2015 April 20. Using a set of light curve templates constructed from SN 1987A-like peculiar Type II SNe, we measure time delays for the four images relative to S1 of 4 ± 4 (for S2), 2 ± 5 (S3), and 24 ± 7 days (S4). The measured magnification ratios relative to S1 are 1.15 ± 0.05 (S2), 1.01 ± 0.04 (S3), and 0.34 ± 0.02 (S4). None of the template light curves fully captures the photometric behavior of SN Refsdal, so we also derive complementary measurements for these parameters using polynomials to represent the intrinsic light curve shape. These more flexible fits deliver fully consistent time delays of 7 ± 2 (S2), 0.6 ± 3 (S3), and 27 ± 8 days (S4). The lensing magnification ratios are similarly consistent, measured as 1.17 ± 0.02 (S2), 1.00 ± 0.01 (S3), and 0.38 ± 0.02 (S4). We compare these measurements against published predictions from lens models, and find that the majority of model predictions are in very good agreement with our measurements. Finally, we discuss avenues for future improvement of time delay measurements—both for SN Refsdal and for other strongly lensed SNe yet to come.},

These SNe were observed using the HST Wide Field Camera 3 infrared detector, with imaging in both wide- and medium-band filters. We demonstrate that the classification and redshift estimates are significantly improved by the inclusion of single-epoch medium-band observations. This medium-band imaging approximates a very low resolution spectrum (λ/∆λ ≲ 100) which can isolate broad spectral absorption features that differentiate SNe Ia from their most common core collapse cousins. This medium-band method is also insensitive to dust extinction and (unlike grism spectroscopy) it is not affected by contamination from the SN host galaxy or other nearby sources. As such, it can provide a more efficient—though less precise—alternative to IR spectroscopy for high-z SNe.},

Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae (SNe) of all types, out to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5. We classify {\textasciitilde}24 of these as Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of six SNe). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z = 2 and putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SNe that exploded when the universe was only {\textasciitilde}3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history. This gives the CANDELS high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SNe Ia that explode promptly after formation (\&lt;500 Myr).

However, mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble), we find a low rate of SNe Ia at z \&gt; 1.

Based on multi-band Hubble Space Telescope and Very Large Telescope (VLT) photometry of the supernova, and VLT spectroscopy of the host galaxy, we find a 97.5\% probability that this SN is a SN Ia, and a 2.5\% chance of a CC SN. Our typing algorithm combines the shape and color of the light curve with the expected rates of each SN type in the host galaxy. With a redshift of 2.2216, this is the highest redshift SN Ia discovered with a spectroscopic host-galaxy redshift. A further distinguishing feature is that the lensing cluster, at redshift 1.23, is the most distant to date to have an amplified SN. The SN lies in the middle of the color and light-curve shape distributions found at lower redshift, disfavoring strong evolution to z = 2.22. We estimate an amplification due to gravitational lensing of \{2.8\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.5{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (1.10 ± 0.23 mag)—compatible with the value estimated from the weak-lensing-derived mass and the mass-concentration relation from ΛCDM simulations—making it the most amplified SN Ia discovered behind a galaxy cluster.},

	abstract = {SN HFF14Tom is a Type Ia SN discovered at z=1.3457+/- 0.0001 behind the galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z = 0.308). In a cosmology-independent analysis, we find that HFF14Tom is 0.77 ± 0.15 mag brighter than unlensed Type Ia SNe at similar redshift, implying a lensing magnification of \{μ \}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}=2.03+/- 0.29. This observed magnification provides a rare opportunity for a direct empirical test of galaxy cluster lens models. Here we test 17 lens models, 13 of which were generated before the SN magnification was known, qualifying as pure “blind tests.” The models are collectively fairly accurate: 8 of the models deliver median magnifications that are consistent with the measured μ to within 1σ. However, there is a subtle systematic bias: the significant disagreements all involve models overpredicting the magnification. We evaluate possible causes for this mild bias, and find no single physical or methodological explanation to account for it. We do find that model accuracy can be improved to some extent with stringent quality cuts on multiply imaged systems, such as requiring that a large fraction have spectroscopic redshifts. In addition to testing model accuracies as we have done here, Type Ia SN magnifications could also be used as inputs for future lens models of Abell 2744 and other clusters, providing valuable constraints in regions where traditional strong- and weak-lensing information is unavailable.},

	abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant from 3.3\% to 2.4\%. The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared (NIR) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable SNe Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ̃300 SNe Ia at z \&lt; 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system NGC 4258 have been observed with WFC3 in the optical and NIR, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a more robust distance to the LMC based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (I) megamasers in NGC 4258, (II) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (III) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes measured with HST/FGS, HST/WFC3 spatial scanning and/or Hipparcos, and (IV) 2 DEBs in M31. The Hubble constant from each is 72.25 ± 2.51, 72.04 ± 2.67, 76.18 ± 2.37, and 74.50 ± 3.27 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, respectively. Our best estimate of H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 73.24 ± 1.74 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} combines the anchors NGC 4258, MW, and LMC, yielding a 2.4\% determination (all quoted uncertainties include fully propagated statistical and systematic components). This value is 3.4σ higher than 66.93 ± 0.62 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} predicted by ΛCDM with 3 neutrino flavors having a mass of 0.06 eV and the new Planck data, but the discrepancy reduces to 2.1σ relative to the prediction of 69.3 ± 0.7 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} based on the comparably precise combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO observations, suggesting that systematic uncertainties in CMB radiation measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck high-redshift measurements and our local determination of H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early universe in the range of ∆N {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≈ 0.4-1. We anticipate further significant improvements in H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from upcoming parallax measurements of long-period MW Cepheids.

Here we show that observations of Type Ia supernovae in the redshift interval 1.5\&lt;z\&lt;3.0, where dark-energy-dependent effects are relatively negligible, should provide direct evidence to discern evolutionary effects. As examples of our approach to constraining evolution, we examine the impact of changing progenitor metallicity and age on the degree of potential luminosity evolution.

	abstract = {We present spectral and photometric observations of 10 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the redshift range 0.16 \&lt;= z \&lt;= 0.62. The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between SN Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 \&lt; 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M \&gt;= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0 \&lt; 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 \&gt;= 0.},

In time-domain astronomy, imaging programmes with a short cadence are able to detect rapidly evolving transients, previously unseen by surveys designed for slowly evolving supernovae. Here, we describe two unusual transient events discovered in a Hubble Space Telescope programme that combined these techniques with high-cadence imaging on a field with a strong-lensing galaxy cluster. These transients were faster and fainter than any supernovae, but substantially more luminous than a classical nova. We find that they can be explained as separate eruptions of a luminous blue variable star or a recurrent nova, or as an unrelated pair of stellar microlensing events. To distinguish between these hypotheses will require clarification of the cluster lens models, along with more high-cadence imaging of the field that could detect related transient episodes. This discovery suggests that the intersection of strong lensing with high-cadence transient surveys may be a fruitful path for future astrophysical transient studies.},

We construct a refined sample of more than 100 multiple images for each cluster by taking advantage of the full-depth HFF images, and conduct mass modeling using the glafic software, which assumes simply parametrized mass distributions. Our mass modeling also exploits a magnification constraint from the lensed SN Ia HFF14Tom for Abell 2744 and positional constraints from the multiple images S1-S4 of the lensed supernova SN Refsdal for MACS J1149.6+2223. We find that our best-fitting mass models reproduce the observed image positions with rms errors of ̃0.″4, which are smaller than rms errors in previous mass modeling that adopted similar numbers of multiple images. Our model predicts a new image of SN Refsdal with a relative time delay and magnification that are fully consistent with a recent detection of reappearance. We then construct catalogs of z ̃ 6-9 dropout galaxies behind the four clusters and estimate magnification factors for these dropout galaxies with our best-fitting mass models. The dropout sample from the four cluster fields contains ̃120 galaxies at z ≳ 6, about 20 of which are predicted to be magnified by a factor of more than 10. Some of the high-redshift galaxies detected in the HFF have lensing-corrected magnitudes of M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}UV{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ̃ -15 to -14. Our analysis demonstrates that the HFF data indeed offer an ideal opportunity to study faint high-redshift galaxies.

The HST light curve of SN Refsdal has a shape consistent with the distinctive, slowly rising light curves of SN 1987A-like SNe, and we find strong evidence for a broad Hα P-Cygni profile and Na I D absorption in the HST grism spectrum at the redshift (z = 1.49) of the spiral host galaxy. SNe IIn, largely powered by circumstellar interaction, could provide a good match to the light curve of SN Refsdal, but the spectrum of a SN IIn would not show broad and strong Hα and Na I D absorption. From the grism spectrum, we measure an Hα expansion velocity consistent with those of SN 1987A-like SNe at a similar phase. The luminosity, evolution, and Gaussian profile of the Hα emission of the WFC3 and X-shooter spectra, separated by ̃2.5 months in the rest frame, provide additional evidence that supports the SN 1987A-like classification. In comparison with other examples of SN 1987A-like SNe, photometry of SN Refsdal favors bluer B - V and V - R colors and one of the largest luminosities for the assumed range of potential magnifications. The evolution of the light curve at late times will provide additional evidence about the potential existence of any substantial circumstellar material.

	abstract = {In Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging taken on 2014 November 10, four images of supernova (SN) “Refsdal” (redshift z = 1.49) appeared in an Einstein-cross-like configuration (images S1-S4) around an early-type galaxy in the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.54). Almost all lens models of the cluster have predicted that the SN should reappear within a year in a second host-galaxy image created by the cluster’s potential. In HST observations taken on 2015 December 11, we find a new source at the predicted position of the new image of SN Refsdal approximately 8{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} from the previous images S1-S4. This marks the first time the appearance of a SN at a particular time and location in the sky was successfully predicted in advance! We use these data and the light curve from the first four observed images of SN Refsdal to place constraints on the relative time delay and magnification of the new image (SX) compared to images S1-S4. This enables us, for the first time, to test “blind” lens model predictions of both magnifications and time delays for a lensed SN. We find that the timing and brightness of the new image are consistent with the blind predictions of a fraction of the models. The reappearance illustrates the discriminatory power of this blind test and its utility to uncover sources of systematic uncertainty. From planned HST photometry, we expect to reach a precision of 1\%-2\% on the time delay between S1-S4 and SX.},

	abstract = {We present Real-time Automated Photometric IDentification (RAPID), a novel time series classification tool capable of automatically identifying transients from within a day of the initial alert, to the full lifetime of a light curve. Using a deep recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units (GRUs), we present the first method specifically designed to provide early classifications of astronomical timeseries data, typing 12 different transient classes. Our classifier can process light curves with any phase coverage, and it does not rely on deriving computationally expensive features from the data, making RAPID well suited for processing the millions of alerts that ongoing and upcoming wide-field surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will produce. The classification accuracy improves over the lifetime of the transient as more photometric data becomes available, and across the 12 transient classes, we obtain an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and 0.98 at early and late epochs, respectively. We demonstrate RAPID's ability to effectively provide early classifications of observed transients from the ZTF data stream. We have made RAPID available as an open-source software package{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for machine-learning-based alert brokers to use for the autonomous and quick classification of several thousand light curves within a few seconds.},

However, upcoming deep photometric surveys, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), will produce a deluge of low signal-to-noise data for which traditional type estimation procedures are inappropriate. Probabilistic classification is more appropriate for such data but is incompatible with the traditional metrics used on deterministic classifications. Furthermore, large survey collaborations like LSST intend to use the resulting classification probabilities for diverse science objectives, indicating a need for a metric that balances a variety of goals. We describe the process used to develop an optimal performance metric for an open classification challenge that seeks to identify probabilistic classifiers that can serve many scientific interests. The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLASTICC) aims to identify promising techniques for obtaining classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging a broader community beyond astronomy. Using mock classification probability submissions emulating realistically complex archetypes of those anticipated of PLASTICC, we compare the sensitivity of two metrics of classification probabilities under various weighting schemes, finding that both yield results that are qualitatively consistent with intuitive notions of classification performance. We thus choose as a metric for PLASTICC a weighted modification of the cross-entropy because it can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of information content. Finally, we propose extensions of our methodology to ever more complex challenge goals and suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric of probabilistic data products.},

In the next decade, transient searches from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) will accelerate this growth, increasing the SNIa sample to several hundred thousand. This HST-AR program will provide an important tool for the next era of SNIa cosmology by developing SALT3 - a new SN Ia model that extends the widely-used SALT2 model to near-infrared wavelengths. We will add the relatively small but powerful dataset of ACS and WFC3-IR observations to a large number of ground-based light curves for model training purposes. The addition of HST data is necessary to push the new model beyond 11000 Angstrom, and will be particularly valuable for improving and extending the SALT2 color law that is presently trained to only 6000 Angstrom.},

These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the MegaPrime/MegaCam instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the SNLS fields. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: A flat ΛCDM cosmological fit to 231 SNLS high redshift type Ia supernovae alone gives Ω\_M = 0.211 ± 0.034(stat) ± 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of ±0.026 on Ω\_M.

It is now a NASA mission in formulation with a planned launch in the mid 2020s. A primary mission objective is to precisely constrain the nature of dark energy through multiple probes, including Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). Here, we present the first realistic simulations of the WFIRST SN survey based on current hardware specifications and using open-source tools. We simulate SN light curves and spectra as viewed by the WFIRST wide-field channel (WFC) imager and integral field channel (IFC) spectrometer, respectively. We examine 11 survey strategies with different time allocations between the WFC and IFC, two of which are based upon the strategy described by the WFIRST Science Definition Team, which measures SN distances exclusively from IFC data. We propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties to predict the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit (FoM) for each strategy. Of the strategies investigated, we find the most successful to be WFC focused. However, further work in constraining systematics is required to fully optimize the use of the IFC. Even without improvements to other cosmological probes, the WFIRST SN survey has the potential to increase the FoM by more than an order of magnitude from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented here have not been fully optimized, these initial investigations are an important step in the development of the final hardware design and implementation of the WFIRST mission.},

It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, WFIRST would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, NASA chartered a Science Definition Team (SDT) to produce, in collaboration with the WFIRST Study Office at GSFC and the Program Office at JPL, a Design Reference Mission (DRM) for an implementation of WFIRST using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to NASA. This DRM builds on the work of the earlier WFIRST SDT, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous WFIRST-2.4 DRM, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of WFIRST as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

This will crucially enable a wide range of new and exciting time-domain science, including high-redshift transient searches and monitoring (e.g., SNe), variability studies from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to brown dwarf atmospheres, as well as proper motions of possibly extreme scattered Kuiper Belt and Inner Oort Cloud Objects, and of nearby Galactic brown dwarfs, low-mass stars, and ultracool white dwarfs.

	abstract = {A galaxy cluster acts as a cosmic telescope over background galaxies but also as a cosmic microscope magnifying the imperfections of the lens. The diverging magnification of lensing caustics enhances the microlensing effect of substructure present within the lensing mass. Fine-scale structure can be accessed as a moving background source brightens and disappears when crossing these caustics. The recent discovery of a distant lensed star near the Einstein radius of the galaxy cluster MACSJ1149.5+2223 allows a rare opportunity to reach subsolar-mass microlensing through a supercritical column of cluster matter. Here we compare these observations with high-resolution ray-tracing simulations that include stellar microlensing set by the observed intracluster starlight and also primordial black holes that may be responsible for the recently observed LIGO events. We explore different scenarios with microlenses from the intracluster medium and black holes, including primordial ones, and examine strategies to exploit these unique alignments. We find that the best constraints on the fraction of compact dark matter (DM) in the small-mass regime can be obtained in regions of the cluster where the intracluster medium plays a negligible role. This new lensing phenomenon should be widespread and can be detected within modest-redshift lensed galaxies so that the luminosity distance is not prohibitive for detecting individual magnified stars. High-cadence Hubble Space Telescope monitoring of several such optimal arcs will be rewarded by an unprecedented mass spectrum of compact objects that can contribute to uncovering the nature of DM.},

We combine the subset of 279 PS1 SNe Ia (0.03 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.68) with useful distance estimates of SNe Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), SNLS, and various low-z and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of SNe Ia, consisting of a total of 1048 SNe Ia in the range of 0.01 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.3, which we call the “Pantheon Sample.” When combining Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements with the Pantheon SN sample, we find \{\{\{Ω \}\}\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.307+/- 0.012 and w=-1.026+/- 0.041 for the wCDM model.

Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of PS1 and low-z SNe has diminished after an increase of 2× in the statistics of the PS1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample.

Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we have imaged 25 galaxy-cluster fields and parallel fields of non-cluster galaxies. We report a sample of 27 SNe discovered in the parallel fields. Of these SNe, {\textasciitilde}13 are classified as SN Ia candidates, including four SN Ia candidates at redshifts z \&gt; 1.2. We measure volumetric SN Ia rates to redshift 1.8 and add the first upper limit on the SN Ia rate in the range 1.8 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.4. The results are consistent with the rates measured by the HST/GOODS and Subaru Deep Field SN surveys. We model these results together with previous measurements at z \&lt; 1 from the literature. The best-fitting SN Ia delay-time distribution (DTD; the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst of star formation and subsequent SN Ia explosions) is a power law with an index of -1.00{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06(0.09)\}\_\{-0.06(0.10)\}{\textbackslash} (statistical) {\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.08\}{\textbackslash} (systematic), where the statistical uncertainty is a result of the 68\% and 95\% (in parentheses) statistical uncertainties reported for the various SN Ia rates (from this work and from the literature), and the systematic uncertainty reflects the range of possible cosmic star-formation histories. We also test DTD models produced by an assortment of published binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations. The shapes of all BPS double-degenerate DTDs are consistent with the volumetric SN Ia measurements, when the DTD models are scaled up by factors of 3-9. In contrast, all BPS single-degenerate DTDs are ruled out by the measurements at \&gt;99\% significance level.},

We classify this object as a SN Ia by comparing its light curve and spectrum with those of a large sample of Type Ia and core-collapse SNe. Its apparent magnitude is consistent with that expected from the ΛCDM concordance cosmology. We discuss the use of spectral evidence for classification of z \&gt; 1.5 SNe Ia using HST grism simulations, finding that spectral data alone can frequently rule out SNe II, but distinguishing between SNe Ia and SNe Ib/c can require prohibitively long exposures. In such cases, a quantitative analysis of the light curve may be necessary for classification.

A sample of 27 low-redshift SNe Ia with well-observed NIR light curves observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) between 2004 and 2007 is used. All 27 objects have premaximum coverage in optical bands, with a subset of 13 having premaximum NIR observations as well; coverage of the other 14 begins shortly after NIR maximum brightness. We describe the methods used to derive light-curve parameters (absolute peak magnitudes and decline rates) from both spline- and template-fitting procedures, and we confirm prior findings that fitting templates to SNe Ia light curves in the NIR is problematic due to the diversity of postmaximum behavior of objects that are characterized by similar ∆m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}15{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(B) values, especially at high decline rates. Nevertheless, we show that NIR light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially if the observations begin within 5 days after NIR maximum. SNe Ia appear to be better “standardizable candles” in the NIR bands than in the optical bands. For the subset of 13 objects in our data set that excludes the highly reddened and fast-declining SNe Ia and includes only those objects for which NIR observations began prior to 5 days after maximum light, we find modest (1.7σ) evidence for a peak-luminosity versus decline-rate relation in Y, and stronger evidence (2.8σ) in J and H. Using R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}V{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} values differing from the canonical value (R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}V{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.1) is shown to have little effect on the results. A Hubble diagram is presented for the NIR bands and the B band. The resulting scatter for the combined NIR bands is 0.13 mag, while the B band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. Finally, we find evidence for a bimodal distribution in the NIR absolute magnitudes of fast-declining SNe Ia [∆m{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}15{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(B) \&gt; 1.7]. These data suggest that applying a correction to SNe Ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to be beneficial in the J and H bands to make SNe Ia more precise distance indicators, but of only marginal importance in the Y band.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w, have been limited by uncertainty in the selection effects and photometric calibration of z \&lt; 0.1 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The Foundation Supernova Survey is designed to lower these uncertainties by creating a new sample of z \&lt; 0.1 SNe Ia observed on the Pan-STARRS system. Here we combine the Foundation sample with SNe from the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey and measure cosmological parameters with 1338 SNe from a single telescope and a single, well-calibrated photometric system. For the first time, both the low-z and high-z data are predominantly discovered by surveys that do not target preselected galaxies, reducing selection bias uncertainties. The z \&gt; 0.1 data include 875 SNe without spectroscopic classifications, and we show that we can robustly marginalize over CC SN contamination. We measure Foundation Hubble residuals to be fainter than the preexisting low-z Hubble residuals by 0.046 ± 0.027 mag (stat + sys). By combining the SN Ia data with cosmic microwave background constraints, we find w = −0.938 ± 0.053, consistent with ΛCDM. With 463 spectroscopically classified SNe Ia alone, we measure w = −0.933 ± 0.061. Using the more homogeneous and better-characterized Foundation sample gives a 55\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty attributed to SN Ia sample selection biases. Although use of just a single photometric system at low and high redshift increases the impact of photometric calibration uncertainties in this analysis, previous low-z samples may have correlated calibration uncertainties that were neglected in past studies. The full Foundation sample will observe up to 800 SNe to anchor the LSST and WFIRST Hubble diagrams.},

	abstract = {We use 1169 Pan-STARRS supernovae (SNe) and 195 low-z (z \&lt; 0.1) SNe Ia to measure cosmological parameters. Though most Pan-STARRS SNe lack spectroscopic classifications, in a previous paper we demonstrated that photometrically classified SNe can be used to infer unbiased cosmological parameters by using a Bayesian methodology that marginalizes over core-collapse (CC) SN contamination. Our sample contains nearly twice as many SNe as the largest previous SN Ia compilation. Combining SNe with cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints from Planck, we measure the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w to be -0.989 ± 0.057 (stat+sys). If w evolves with redshift as w(a) = w {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} + w {\textless}SUB{\textgreater} a {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(1 - a), we find w {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -0.912 ± 0.149 and w {\textless}SUB{\textgreater} a {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -0.513 ± 0.826. These results are consistent with cosmological parameters from the Joint Light-curve Analysis and the Pantheon sample. We try four different photometric classification priors for Pan-STARRS SNe and two alternate ways of modeling CC SN contamination, finding that no variant gives a w differing by more than 2\% from the baseline measurement. The systematic uncertainty on w due to marginalizing over CC SN contamination, \{σ \vphantom{\{}\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}w{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}CC{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\}=0.012, is the third-smallest source of systematic uncertainty in this work. We find limited (1.6σ) evidence for evolution of the SN color-luminosity relation with redshift, a possible systematic that could constitute a significant uncertainty in future high-z analyses. Our data provide one of the best current constraints on w, demonstrating that samples with ̃5\% CC SN contamination can give competitive cosmological constraints when the contaminating distribution is marginalized over in a Bayesian framework.},

	abstract = {This paper presents new deep and wide narrow-band surveys undertaken with United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), Subaru and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), a unique combined effort to select large, robust samples of Hα star-forming galaxies at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23 (corresponding to look-back times of 4.2, 7.0, 9.2 and 10.6 Gyr) in a uniform manner over ̃2 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} in the Cosmological Evolution Survey and Ultra Deep Survey fields. The deep multi-epoch Hα surveys reach a matched 3σ flux limit of ≈3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} out to z = 2.2 for the first time, while the wide area and the coverage over two independent fields allow us to greatly overcome cosmic variance and assemble by far the largest samples of Hα emitters. Catalogues are presented for a total of 1742, 637, 515 and 807 Hα emitters, robustly selected at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23, respectively, and used to determine the Hα luminosity function and its evolution. The faint-end slope of the Hα luminosity function is found to be α = -1.60 ± 0.08 over z = 0-2.23, showing no significant evolution. The characteristic luminosity of star-forming galaxies, L*{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Hα{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, evolves significantly as log L*{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Hα{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(z) = 0.45z + log L*{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}z = 0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. This is the first time Hα has been used to trace star formation activity with a single homogeneous survey at z = 0.4-2.23. Overall, the evolution seen with Hα is in good agreement with the evolution seen using inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as far-infrared and ultraviolet, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the evolution in the last 11 Gyr being driven by a statistically similar star-forming population across cosmic time, but with a strong luminosity increase from z ̃ 0 to ̃2.2. Our uniform analysis allows us to derive the Hα star formation history (SFRH) of the Universe, showing a clear rise up to z ̃ 2.2, for which the simple parametrization log{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}ρ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}SFR{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -2.1(1 + z){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} is valid over 80 per cent of the age of the Universe. The results reveal that both the shape and normalization of the Hα SFRH are consistent with the measurements of the stellar mass density growth, confirming that our Hα SFRH is tracing the bulk of the formation of stars in the Universe for z \&lt; 2.23. The star formation activity over the last ̃11 Gyr is responsible for producing ̃95 per cent of the total stellar mass density observed locally, with half of that being assembled in 2 Gyr between z = 1.2 and 2.2, and the other half in 8 Gyr (since z \&lt; 1.2). If the star formation rate density continues to decline with time in the same way as seen in the past ̃11 Gyr, then the stellar mass density of the Universe will reach a maximum which is only 5 per cent higher than the present-day value.},

In this work we present predictions from a galaxy formation model, Galacticus, for the cumulative number counts of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-emitting galaxies. We couple Galacticus to three different dust attenuation methods and examine the counts using each method. A \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ minimisation approach is used to compare the model predictions to observed galaxy counts and calibrate the dust parameters. We find that weak dust attenuation is required for the Galacticus counts to be broadly consistent with the observations, though the optimum dust parameters return large values for \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$, suggesting that further calibration of Galacticus is necessary. The model predictions are also consistent with observed estimates for the optical depth and the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity function. Finally we present forecasts for the redshift distributions and number counts for two Euclid-like and one WFIRST-like survey. For a Euclid-like survey with redshift range \$0.9{\textbackslash}leqslant z{\textbackslash}leqslant 1.8\$ and H\${\textbackslash}alpha+\{{\textbackslash}rm [NII]\}\$ blended flux limit of \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-16\}\{{\textbackslash}rm erg\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm cm\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ we predict a number density between 3900--4800 galaxies per square degree.

WISP is obtaining slitless, near-infrared grism spectroscopy of {\textasciitilde}90 independent, high-latitude fields by observing in the pure-parallel mode with the Wide Field Camera Three on the Hubble Space Telescope for a total of {\textasciitilde}250 orbits. Spectra are obtained with the G {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}102{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (λ = 0.8-1.17 μm, R {\textasciitilde}210) and G {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}141{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} grisms (λ = 1.11-1.67 μm, R {\textasciitilde}130), together with direct imaging in the J and H bands (F110W and F140W, respectively). In the present paper, we present the first results from 19 WISP fields, covering approximately 63 arcmin{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. For typical exposure times ({\textasciitilde}6400 s in G {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}102{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and {\textasciitilde}2700 s in G {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}141{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), we reach 5σ detection limits for emission lines of f {\textasciitilde} 5 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-17{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for compact objects. Typical direct imaging 5σ limits are 26.3 and 26.1 mag. (AB) in F110W and F140W, respectively. Restricting ourselves to the lines measured with the highest confidence, we present a list of 328 emission lines, in 229 objects, in a redshift range 0.3 \&lt; z \&lt; 3. The single-line emitters are likely to be a mix of Hα and [O III]5007,4959 Å, with Hα predominating. The overall surface density of high-confidence emission-line objects in our sample is approximately 4 per arcmin{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. These first fields show high equivalent width sources, active galactic nucleus, and post-starburst galaxies. The median observed star formation rate (SFR) of our Hα-selected sample is 4 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. At intermediate redshifts, we detect emission lines in galaxies as faint as H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}140{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 25, or M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}R{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; -19, and are sensitive to SFRs down to less than 1 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

Altogether we identify 1048 emission line galaxies with observed equivalent widths greater than 40 Å, 467 of which have multiple detected emission lines. We use simulations to correct for significant (\&gt;20\%) incompleteness introduced in part by the non-dithered, non-rotated nature of the grism parallels.

Hα-emitting galaxies with comparable [O III] flux are roughly five times less common than galaxies with just Hα emission at those flux levels. Galaxies with low Hα/[O III] ratios are very rare at the brighter fluxes that future near-infrared grism surveys will probe; our survey finds no galaxies with Hα/[O III] \&lt; 0.95 that have Hα flux greater than 3 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-16{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Our Hα luminosity function contains a comparable number density of faint line emitters to that found by the Near IR Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer near-infrared grism surveys, but significantly fewer (factors of 3-4 less) high-luminosity emitters. We also find that our high-redshift (z = 0.9-1.5) counts are in agreement with the high-redshift (z = 1.47) narrowband Hα survey of HiZELS (Sobral et al.), while our lower redshift luminosity function (z = 0.3-0.9) falls slightly below their z = 0.84 result. The evolution in both the Hα luminosity function from z = 0.3-1.5 and the [O III] luminosity function from z = 0.7-2.3 is almost entirely in the L {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sstarf{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} parameter, which steadily increases with redshift over those ranges.},

	abstract = {In order for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and other stage IV dark energy experiments (e.g., Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, LSST; and Euclid) to infer cosmological parameters not limited by systematic errors, accurate redshift measurements are needed. This accuracy can be met by using spectroscopic subsamples to calibrate the photometric redshifts for the full sample. In this work, we find the minimal number of spectra required for the WFIRST weak-lensing redshift calibration by employing the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) spectroscopic sampling technique. We use galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to build the LSST+WFIRST lensing analog sample of ∼36,000 objects and to train the LSST+WFIRST SOM. We find that 26\% of the WFIRST lensing sample consists of sources fainter than the Euclid depth in the optical, 91\% of which live in color cells already occupied by brighter galaxies. We demonstrate the similarity between faint and bright galaxies as well as the feasibility of redshift measurements at different brightness levels. Our results suggest that the spectroscopic sample acquired for calibration to the Euclid depth is sufficient for calibrating the majority of the WFIRST color space. For the spectroscopic sample to fully represent the synthetic color space of WFIRST, we recommend obtaining additional spectroscopy of ∼0.2–1.2k new sources in cells occupied by mostly faint galaxies. We argue that either the small area of the CANDELS fields and the small overall sample size or the large photometric errors might be the reason for no/fewer bright galaxies mapped to these cells. Acquiring the spectra of these sources will confirm the above findings and will enable the comprehensive calibration of the WFIRST color–redshift relation.},

	abstract = {Current and future weak-lensing surveys will rely on photometrically estimated redshifts of very large numbers of galaxies. In this paper, we address several different aspects of the demanding photo-z performance that will be required for future experiments, such as the proposed ESA Euclid mission. It is first shown that the proposed all-sky near-infrared photometry from Euclid, in combination with anticipated ground-based photometry (e.g. PanStarrs-2 or DES) should yield the required precision in individual photo-z of σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}z{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(z) \&lt;= 0.05(1 + z) at I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}AB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt;= 24.5. Simple a priori rejection schemes based on the photometry alone can be tuned to recognize objects with wildly discrepant photo-z and to reduce the outlier fraction to \&lt;=0.25 per cent with only modest loss of otherwise usable objects. Turning to the more challenging problem of determining the mean redshift \&lt; z\&gt; of a set of galaxies to a precision of {\textbar}∆{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;z\&gt;{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textbar} \&lt;= 0.002(1 + z) we argue that, for many different reasons, this may be best accomplished by relying on the photo-z themselves rather than on the direct measurement of \&lt; z\&gt; from spectroscopic redshifts of a representative subset of the galaxies, as has usually been envisaged. We present in Appendix A an analysis of the substantial difficulties in the latter approach that arise from the presence of large-scale structure in spectroscopic survey fields. A simple adaptive scheme based on the statistical properties of the photo-z likelihood functions is shown to meet this stringent systematic requirement, although further tests on real data will be required to verify this. We also examine the effect of an imprecise correction for Galactic extinction on the photo-z and the precision with which the Galactic extinction can be determined from the photometric data itself, for galaxies with or without spectroscopic redshifts. We also explore the effects of contamination by fainter overlapping objects in photo-z determination. The overall conclusion of this paper is that the acquisition of photometrically estimated redshifts with the precision required for Euclid, or other similar experiments, will be challenging but possible.},

The existing library of SED models has excellent optical templates, but limited, poorly constrained coverage of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) wavelengths. However, both regimes are critical for the design and operation of future SN surveys, particularly at IR wavelengths that will be accessible with the James Webb Space Telescope and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope. We create a public repository of improved empirical SED templates using a sampling of Type Ia and core-collapse (CC) photometric light curves to extend the Type Ia parameterized SALT2 model and a set of SN Ib, SN Ic, and SN II SED templates into the UV and near-IR. We apply this new repository of extrapolated SN SED models to examine how future surveys can discriminate between CC and Type Ia SNe at UV and IR wavelengths, and present an open-source software package written in Python, SNSEDextend, that enables users to generate their own extrapolated SEDs.},

	abstract = {Recently, there have been two landmark discoveries of gravitationally lensed supernovae: the first multiply imaged SN, “Refsdal”, and the first Type Ia SN resolved into multiple images, SN iPTF16geu. Fitting the multiple light curves of such objects can deliver measurements of the lensing time delays, which are the difference in arrival times for the separate images. These measurements provide precise tests of lens models or constraints on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters that are independent of the local distance ladder. Over the next decade, accurate time delay measurements will be needed for the tens to hundreds of lensed SNe to be found by wide-field time-domain surveys such as LSST and WFIRST. We have developed an open-source software package for simulations and time delay measurements of multiply imaged SNe, including an improved characterization of the uncertainty caused by microlensing. Using this package, we describe simulations that suggest that a before-peak detection of the leading image enables a more accurate and precise time delay measurement (by ∼1 and ∼2 days, respectively), when compared to an after-peak detection. We also conclude that fitting the effects of microlensing without an accurate prior often leads to biases in the time delay measurement and over-fitting to the data, but that employing a Gaussian Process Regression technique is sufficient for determining the uncertainty due to microlensing.},

	abstract = {Ongoing and future imaging surveys represent significant improvements in depth, area, and seeing compared to current data sets. These improvements offer the opportunity to discover up to three orders of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lenses than are currently known. In this work we forecast the number of lenses that will be discoverable in forthcoming surveys and simulate their properties. We generate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and Euclid surveys. We verify our model against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, predicting 250 discoverable lenses compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al. The predicted Einstein radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by Sonnenfeld et al. For future surveys we find that, assuming Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches of the DES, LSST, and Euclid data sets should discover 2400, 120000, and 170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses, respectively. Finders using blue-minus-red (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in DES and LSST. The uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high-redshift source population, which typically gives fractional errors on the discoverable lens number at the level of tens of percent. We find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens to be detectable approximately halves the number of detectable lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of understanding the selection function and the sensitivity of future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes publicly available so that the selection function of strong lens finders can easily be calibrated.},

	abstract = {We present {\textbackslash}texttt\{DASH\} (Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier), a novel software package that automates the classification of the type, age, redshift, and host galaxy of supernova spectra. {\textbackslash}texttt\{DASH\} makes use of a new approach which does not rely on iterative template matching techniques like all previous software, but instead classifies based on the learned features of each supernova type and age bin. It has achieved this by employing a deep convolutional neural network to train a matching algorithm. This approach has enabled {\textbackslash}texttt\{DASH\} to be orders of magnitude faster than previous tools, being able to accurately classify hundreds or thousands of objects within seconds. We have tested its performance on the last four years of data from the ongoing Australian Dark Energy Survey (OzDES). The deep learning models were developed using {\textbackslash}texttt\{TensorFlow\}, and were trained using over 4000 supernova templates taken from the CfA Supernova Program and the Berkeley SN Ia Program as used in {\textbackslash}texttt\{SNID\} (Supernova Identification software, Blondin \&amp; Tonry (2007)). The trained models are independent of the number of templates, which allows for {\textbackslash}texttt\{DASH\}'s unprecedented speed. We have developed both a graphical interface for easy visual classification and analysis of supernovae, and a {\textbackslash}texttt\{Python\} library for the autonomous and quick classification of several supernova spectra. The speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and versatility of {\textbackslash}texttt\{DASH\} presents an advancement to existing spectral classification tools. We have made the code publicly available on {\textbackslash}texttt\{GitHub\} and PyPI ({\textbackslash}texttt\{pip install astrodash\}) to allow for further contributions and development.

	abstract = {We present updated constraints on the free-streaming nature of cosmological neutrinos from cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra, baryonic acoustic oscillation data, and distance ladder measurements of the Hubble constant. Specifically, we consider a Fermi-like four-fermion interaction between massless neutrinos, characterized by an effective coupling constant G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and resulting in a neutrino opacity dot tau{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}νpropto{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ν{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Using a conservative flat prior on the parameter log{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}( G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} MeV{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}), we find a bimodal posterior distribution with two clearly separated regions of high probability. The first of these modes is consistent with the standard ΛCDM cosmology and corresponds to neutrinos decoupling at redshift z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ν,dec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 1.3×10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, that is before the Fourier modes probed by the CMB damping tail enter the causal horizon. The other mode of the posterior, dubbed the "interacting neutrino mode", corresponds to neutrino decoupling occurring within a narrow redshift window centered around z{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}ν,dec{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}8300. This mode is characterized by a high value of the effective neutrino coupling constant, log{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}( G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} MeV{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) = -1.72 ± 0.10 (68\% C.L.), together with a lower value of the scalar spectral index and amplitude of fluctuations, and a higher value of the Hubble parameter. Using both a maximum likelihood analysis and the ratio of the two mode's Bayesian evidence, we find the interacting neutrino mode to be statistically disfavored compared to the standard ΛCDM cosmology, and determine this result to be largely driven by the low-l CMB temperature data. Interestingly, the addition of CMB polarization and direct Hubble constant measurements significantly raises the statistical significance of this secondary mode, indicating that new physics in the neutrino sector could help explain the difference between local measurements of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and those inferred from CMB data. A robust consequence of our results is that neutrinos must be free streaming long before the epoch of matter-radiation equality in order to fit current cosmological data.},

These stellar and galactic data have the potential of yielding new insights into topics ranging from the formation history of the Milky Way to the mass of the neutrino. However, enabling the astronomy community to fully exploit this multi-instrument data set is a challenging technical task: for much of the science, we will need to combine the photometry across multiple wavelengths with varying spectral and spatial resolution.

	abstract = {The six parameters of the standard ΛCDM model have best-fit values derived from the Planck temperature power spectrum that are shifted somewhat from the best-fit values derived from WMAP data. These shifts are driven by features in the Planck temperature power spectrum at angular scales that had never before been measured to cosmic-variance level precision. We have investigated these shifts to determine whether they are within the range of expectation and to understand their origin in the data. Taking our parameter set to be the optical depth of the reionized intergalactic medium τ, the baryon density ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, the matter density ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, the angular size of the sound horizon θ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}- 2τ{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (where A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum), we have examined the change in best-fit values between a WMAP-like large angular-scale data set (with multipole moment ℓ \&lt; 800 in the Planck temperature power spectrum) and an all angular-scale data set (ℓ \&lt; 2500Planck temperature power spectrum), each with a prior on τ of 0.07 ± 0.02. We find that the shifts, in units of the 1σ expected dispersion for each parameter, are \{ ∆τ,∆A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}- 2τ{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater},∆n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater},∆ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater},∆ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater},∆θ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \} = \{ -1.7,-2.2,1.2,-2.0,1.1,0.9 \}, with a χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} value of 8.0. We find that this χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} value is exceeded in 15\% of our simulated data sets, and that a parameter deviates by more than 2.2σ in 9\% of simulated data sets, meaning that the shifts are not unusually large. Comparing ℓ \&lt; 800 instead to ℓ\&gt; 800, or splitting at a different multipole, yields similar results. We examined the ℓ \&lt; 800 model residuals in the ℓ\&gt; 800 power spectrum data and find that the features there that drive these shifts are a set of oscillations across a broad range of angular scales. Although they partly appear similar to the effects of enhanced gravitational lensing, the shifts in ΛCDM parameters that arise in response to these features correspond to model spectrum changes that are predominantly due to non-lensing effects; the only exception is τ, which, at fixed A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}- 2τ{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, affects the ℓ\&gt; 800 temperature power spectrum solely through the associated change in A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and the impact of that on the lensing potential power spectrum. We also ask, "what is it about the power spectrum at ℓ \&lt; 800 that leads to somewhat different best-fit parameters than come from the full ℓ range?" We find that if we discard the data at ℓ \&lt; 30, where there is a roughly 2σ downward fluctuation in power relative to the model that best fits the full ℓ range, the ℓ \&lt; 800 best-fit parameters shift significantly towards the ℓ \&lt; 2500 best-fit parameters. In contrast, including ℓ \&lt; 30, this previously noted "low-ℓ deficit" drives n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} up and impacts parameters correlated with n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, such as ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. As expected, the ℓ \&lt; 30 data have a much greater impact on the ℓ \&lt; 800 best fit than on the ℓ \&lt; 2500 best fit. So although the shifts are not very significant, we find that they can be understood through the combined effects of an oscillatory-like set of high-ℓ residuals and the deficit in low-ℓ power, excursions consistent with sample variance that happen to map onto changes in cosmological parameters. Finally, we examine agreement between PlanckTT data and two other CMB data sets, namely the Planck lensing reconstruction and the TT power spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope, again finding a lack of convincing evidence of any significant deviations in parameters, suggesting that current CMB data sets give an internally consistent picture of the ΛCDM model.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu\&lt; 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

To perform the analysis, we employ the current cosmological observations, including the cosmic microwave background temperature power spectrum data from the Planck mission, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, the type Ia supernova data, the redshift space distortion measurements, the shear data of weak lensing observation, the Planck lensing measurement, and the latest direct measurement of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} as well. We show that, compared to the Λ CDM cosmology, the holographic dark energy cosmology with sterile neutrinos can relieve the tension between the Planck observation and the direct measurement of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} much better. Once we include the H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurement in the global fit, we find that the hint of the existence of sterile neutrinos in the holographic dark energy cosmology can be given.

We find that a phantom-like dark energy component, with effective equation of state w = -1.29{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.15{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 68\% c.l. can solve the current tension between the Planck dataset and the R16 prior in an extended ΛCDM scenario. On the other hand, the neutrino effective number is fully compatible with standard expectations. This result is confirmed when including cosmic shear data from the CFHTLenS survey and CMB lensing constraints from Planck.

	abstract = {The tension between the best fit parameters derived by the Planck team and a number of other astronomical measurements suggests either systematics in the astronomical measurements, systematics in the Planck data, the need for new physics, or a combination thereof. We reanalyze the Planck data and find that the 217 GHz ×217 GHz detector set spectrum used in the Planck analysis is responsible for some of this tension. We use a map-based foreground cleaning procedure, relying on a combination of 353 GHz and 545 GHz maps to reduce residual foregrounds in the intermediate frequency maps used for cosmological inference. For our baseline data analysis, which uses 47\% of the sky and makes use of both 353 and 545 GHz data for foreground cleaning, we find the Λ CDM cosmological parameters Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}h{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}=0.1170 ±0.0025 , n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.9686 ±0.0069 , H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=68.0 ±1.1 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} , Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}h{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}=0.02197 ±0.00026 , ln 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=3.082 ±0.025 , and τ =0.090 ±0.013 . While in broad agreement with the results reported by the Planck team, these revised parameters imply a universe with a lower matter density of Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.302 ±0.015 , and parameter values generally more consistent with pre-Planck CMB analyses and astronomical observations. We compare our cleaning procedure with the foreground modeling used by the Planck team and find good agreement. The difference in parameters between our analysis and that of the Planck team is mostly due to our use of cross-spectra from the publicly available survey maps instead of their use of the detector set cross-spectra which include pixels only observed in one of the surveys. We show evidence suggesting residual systematics in the detector set spectra used in the Planck likelihood code, which is substantially reduced for our spectra. Using our cleaned survey cross-spectra, we recompute the limit on neutrino species and find N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=3.34 ±0.35 .

I explore different outlier rejection criteria designed to give a reduced χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} of unity and compare the results with the R11 rejection algorithm, which produces a reduced χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} that is substantially less than unity and, in some cases, leads to underestimates of the errors on parameters. I show that there are sub-luminous low-metallicity Cepheids in the R11 sample that skew the global fits of the period-luminosity relation. This has a small but non-negligible impact on the global fits using NGC 4258 as a distance scale anchor, but adds a poorly constrained source of systematic error when using the Large Magellanic Cloud as an anchor. I also show that the small Milky Way Cepheid sample with accurate parallax measurements leads to a distance to NGC 4258 that is in tension with the maser distance. I conclude that H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} based on the NGC 4258 maser distance is H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 70.6 ± 3.3 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, compatible within 1σ with the recent determination from Planck for the base six-parameter Λ cold dark matter cosmology.

The lens-mass model consists of two elliptical mass distributions with power-law density profiles and an external shear, totaling 22 free parameters, including the density slopes that are the key parameters for determining the value of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} from lens time delays. This has required the development of a new lens code that is highly optimized for speed. The minimum-χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} model reproduces all observations very well, including the stellar velocity dispersion and the shape of the Einstein ring. A combined gravitational lens and stellar dynamical analysis leads to a value of the Hubble constant of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=75{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+7{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}- 1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater} -1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (68\% CL; Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}m{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.3, Ω{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.7). The nonlinear error analysis includes correlations between all free parameters, in particular the density slopes of G1 and G2, yielding an accurate determination of the random error on H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The lens galaxy G1 is {\textasciitilde}5 times more massive than the secondary lens galaxy (G2) and has a mass density slope of γ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}'{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}G1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=2.03{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.14{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}+/-0.03 (68\% CL) for ρ{\textasciitilde}r{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-γ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}'{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, very close to isothermal (γ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}'{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}=2). After extinction correction, G1 exhibits a smooth surface brightness distribution with an R{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}1/4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} profile and no apparent evidence for tidal disruption by interactions with G2. Given the scope of the observational constraints and the gravitational lens models, as well as the careful corrections to the data, we believe this value of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to be little affected by known systematic errors (\&lt;{\textasciitilde}5\%).

We investigate to what degree the so-called fast-declining SNe Ia can be used to determine accurate extragalactic distances. We estimate the intrinsic scatter in the luminosity-decline rate relation and find it ranges from ±0.13 mag to ±0.18 mag with no obvious dependence on wavelength. Using the Cepheid variable star data from the SH0ES project, the SN Ia distance scale is calibrated and the Hubble constant is estimated using our optical and near-infrared sample, and these results are compared to those determined exclusively from a near-infrared subsample. The systematic effect of the supernova’s host galaxy mass is investigated as a function of wavelength and is found to decrease toward redder wavelengths, suggesting this effect may be due to dust properties of the host. Using estimates of the dust extinction derived from optical and near-infrared wavelengths and applying these to the H band, we derive a Hubble constant \{H\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=73.2+/-2.3 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \{Mpc\vphantom{\{}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, whereas using a simple B - V color correction applied to the B band yields \{H\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=72.7+/-2.1 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \{Mpc\vphantom{\{}\}\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {The most precise local measurements of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} rely on observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) coupled with Cepheid distances to SN Ia host galaxies. Recent results have shown tension comparing H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to the value inferred from CMB observations assuming ΛCDM, making it important to check for potential systematic uncertainties in either approach. To date, precise local H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} measurements have used SN Ia distances based on optical photometry, with corrections for light curve shape and colour. Here, we analyse SNe Ia as standard candles in the near-infrared (NIR), where luminosity variations in the supernovae and extinction by dust are both reduced relative to the optical. From a combined fit to 9 nearby calibrator SNe with host Cepheid distances from Riess et al. (2016) and 27 SNe in the Hubble flow, we estimate the absolute peak J magnitude M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -18.524 ± 0.041 mag and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 72.8 ± 1.6 (statistical) ±2.7 (systematic) km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The 2.2\% statistical uncertainty demonstrates that the NIR provides a compelling avenue to measuring SN Ia distances, and for our sample the intrinsic (unmodeled) peak J magnitude scatter is just 0.10 mag, even without light curve shape or colour corrections. Our results do not vary significantly with different sample selection criteria, though photometric calibration in the NIR may be a dominant systematic uncertainty. Our findings suggest that tension in the competing H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} distance ladders is likely not a result of supernova systematics that could be expected to vary between optical and NIR wavelengths, like dust extinction. We anticipate further improvements in H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} with a larger calibrator sample of SNe Ia with Cepheid distances, more Hubble flow SNe Ia with NIR light curves, and better use of the full NIR photometric data set beyond simply the peak J-band magnitude.},

	abstract = {The temporal evolution of the optical spectra of various types of supernovae (SNe) is illustrated, in part to aid observers classifying supernova candidates. Type II SNe are defined by the presence of hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient SNe (Type I), three subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si II (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si II nor He I (Ic). The late-time spectra of SNe Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of SNe Ib and SNe Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although SNe Ia, which result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. SNe Ib/Ic probably result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically related to SNe II. Indeed, the progenitors of some SNe II seem to have only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to resemble those of SNe Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric subclasses (linear and plateau) of SNe II, which may exhibit minor spectroscopic differences, there is a new subclass (SNe IIn) distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves. These objects probably have unusually dense circumstellar gas with which the ejecta interact.},

We develop a diagnostic to quantify the quality of a correlation between the input and template spectra, which enables a formal evaluation of the associated redshift error. Furthermore, by comparing the correlation redshifts obtained using SNID with those determined from narrow lines in the SN host galaxy spectrum, we show that accurate redshifts (with a typical error σ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}z{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textasciitilde}0.01) can be determined for SNe Ia without a spectrum of the host galaxy.

The success of the correlation technique confirms the similarity of some SNe Ia at low and high redshifts.

Light curves from the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are further affected by superimposed variability due to microlensing. In order to disentangle the microlensing from the intrinsic variability of the light curves, the time delays between the multiple images have to be accurately measured. The resulting microlensing light curves can then be analyzed to reveal information about the background source, such as the size of the quasar accretion disk. In this paper we present the most extensive and coherent collection of simulated microlensing light curves; we have generated {\textbackslash}gt 2.5 billion light curves using the GERLUMPH high resolution microlensing magnification maps.

We present here the GERLUMPH Data Release 1, which consists of 12,342 high resolution cosmological microlensing magnification maps and provides the first uniform coverage of the convergence, shear, and smooth matter fraction parameter space. We use these maps to perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the mass-sheet degeneracy, finding excellent agreement with its predictions. We study the effect of smooth matter on microlensing induced magnification fluctuations. In particular, in the minima and saddle-point regions, fluctuations are enhanced only along the critical line, while in the maxima region they are always enhanced for high smooth matter fractions (≈0.9). We describe our approach to data management, including the use of an SQL database with a Web interface for data access and online analysis, obviating the need for individuals to download large volumes of data. In combination with existing observational databases and online applications, the GERLUMPH archive represents a fundamental component of a new microlensing eResearch cloud.

Both being potential hosts of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, GLADE includes inactive and active galaxies as well.

The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) has been tasked with deriving constraints on cosmological parameters from LSST data. Each of the cosmological probes for LSST is heavily impacted by the choice of observing strategy. This white paper is written by the LSST DESC Observing Strategy Task Force (OSTF), which represents the entire collaboration, and aims to make recommendations on observing strategy that will benefit all cosmological analyses with LSST. It is accompanied by the DESC DDF (Deep Drilling Fields) white paper (Scolnic et al.). We use a variety of metrics to understand the effects of the observing strategy on measurements of weak lensing, large-scale structure, clusters, photometric redshifts, supernovae, strong lensing and kilonovae. In order to reduce systematic uncertainties, we conclude that the current baseline observing strategy needs to be significantly modified to result in the best possible cosmological constraints. We provide some key recommendations: moving the WFD (Wide-Fast-Deep) footprint to avoid regions of high extinction, taking visit pairs in different filters, changing the 2x15s snaps to a single exposure to improve efficiency, focusing on strategies that reduce long gaps (\&gt;15 days) between observations, and prioritizing spatial uniformity at several intervals during the 10-year survey.},

	abstract = {We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of PS1-10afx, a unique hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN) at redshift z = 1.388. The light curve peaked at z {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}P1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known SNe, with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}u{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and near-infrared observations indicate that the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast timescale of {\textasciitilde}12 days to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}44{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}bol{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the spectral energy distribution is unusually red for an SLSN, with a color temperature of {\textasciitilde}6800 K near maximum light, in contrast to previous hydrogen-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the ultraviolet (UV). The spectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with a photospheric velocity of {\textasciitilde}11, 000 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and evidence for line blanketing in the rest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large emitting radius (gsim 5 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}15{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (1) a nickel-powered light curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast timescale; (2) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (3) models invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the observed spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in pre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of {\textasciitilde}15 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and is fairly massive ({\textasciitilde}2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), with a stellar population age of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}8{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} yr, also in contrast to the young dwarf hosts of known hydrogen-poor SLSNe. PS1-10afx is distinct from known examples of SLSNe in its spectra, colors, light-curve shape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a different channel than other hydrogen-poor SLSNe.},

	abstract = {Exploring the recent expansion history of the universe promises insights into the cosmological model, the nature of dark energy, and potentially clues to high energy physics theories and gravitation. We examine the extent to which precision distance-redshift observations can map out the history, including the acceleration-deceleration transition, and the components and equations of state of the energy density. We consider the ability to distinguish between various dynamical scalar field models for the dark energy, as well as higher dimension and alternate gravity theories. Finally, we present a new, advantageous parametrization for the study of dark energy.},

Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}13{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to quantify the tension between datasets, we find that the tensions are relieved by an evolving dark energy, with the dynamical dark energy model preferred at a 3.5σ significance level based on the improvement in the fit alone. While, at present, the Bayesian evidence for the dynamical dark energy is insufficient to favour it over ΛCDM, we show that, if the current best-fit dark energy happened to be the true model, it would be decisively detected by the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.},

We combine these SNe Ia with a new compilation of ̃1050 SNe Ia, jointly calibrated and corrected for simulated survey biases to produce accurate distance measurements. We present unbiased constraints on the expansion rate at six redshifts in the range 0.07\&lt; z\&lt; 1.5 based only on this combined SN Ia sample. The added leverage of our new sample at z\&gt; 1.5 leads to a factor of ̃3 improvement in the determination of the expansion rate at z = 1.5, reducing its uncertainty to ̃20\%, a measurement of H(z=1.5)/\{H\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = \{2.69\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.52{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.86{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We then demonstrate that these six derived expansion rate measurements alone provide a nearly identical characterization of dark energy as the full SN sample, making them an efficient compression of the SN Ia data. The new sample of SNe Ia at z\&gt; 1.5 usefully distinguishes between alternative cosmological models and unmodeled evolution of the SN Ia distance indicators, placing empirical limits on the latter. Finally, employing a realistic simulation of a potential Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope SN survey observing strategy, we forecast optimistic future constraints on the expansion rate from SNe Ia.},

	abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry of a selected sample of 50 long-period, low-extinction Milky Way Cepheids measured on the same WFC3 F555W-, F814W-, and F160W-band photometric system as extragalactic Cepheids in Type Ia supernova host galaxies. These bright Cepheids were observed with the WFC3 spatial scanning mode in the optical and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach a mean photometric error of 5 mmag per observation. We use the new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and HST photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the DR2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be -46 ± 13 μas or ±6 μas for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from DR2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006 ± 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 73.24 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with ΛCDM at the 2.9σ confidence level (99.6\%). At 96.5\% confidence we find that the formal DR2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the DR2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8σ (99.99\%). With the final expected precision from Gaia, the sample of 50 Cepheids with HST photometry will limit to 0.5\% the contribution of the first rung of the distance ladder to the uncertainty in H {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {Strong lensing time-delay systems constrain cosmological parameters via the so-called time-delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the lens. In previous studies, only the former information was used in forecasting cosmographic constraints. In this paper, we show that the cosmological constraints improve significantly when the latter information is also included. Specifically, the angular diameter distance plays a crucial role in breaking the degeneracy between the curvature of the Universe and the time-varying equation of state of dark energy. Using a mock sample of 55 bright quadruple lens systems based on expectations for ongoing/future imaging surveys, we find that adding the angular diameter distance information to the time-delay distance information and the Planck's measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies improves the constraint on the constant equation of state by 30\%, on the time variation in the equation of state by a factor of two, and on the Hubble constant in the flat ΛCDM model by a factor of two. Therefore, previous forecasts for the statistical power of time-delay systems were overly pessimistic, i.e., time-delay systems are more powerful than previously appreciated.},

matter in the massive Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, and tell us how
the dark matter, cluster gas, and dynamics of the clusters influence the
galaxies in and around them. These studies are possible because the
Spitzer Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton, and
