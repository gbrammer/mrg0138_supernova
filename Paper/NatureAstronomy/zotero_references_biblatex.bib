Despite, or perhaps because of, significant efforts to determine accurate distances, using a wide range of methods, tracers, and techniques, an internally consistent astronomical distance framework has not yet been established. We review current efforts to homogenize the Local Group's distance framework, with particular emphasis on the potential of {RR} Lyrae stars as distance indicators, and attempt to extend this in an internally consistent manner to cosmological distances. Calibration based on Type Ia supernovae and distance determinations based on gravitational lensing represent particularly promising approaches. We provide a positive outlook to improvements to the status quo expected from future surveys, missions, and facilities. Astronomical distance determination has clearly reached maturity and near-consistency.},

supernovae can provide microlensing-free time-delay measurements
provided that the measurement is taken during the achromatic expansion
phase of the explosion and that color light curves are used rather than
single-band light curves. If verified, this would provide both precise
and accurate time-delay measurements, making lensed type-Ia supernovae a
new golden standard for time-delay cosmography. However, the 3D geometry
of the expanding shell can introduce an additional bias that has not yet
been fully explored. In this work, we present and discuss the impact of
this effect on time-delay cosmography with lensed supernovae and find
that on average it leads to a bias of a few tenths of a day for
individual lensed systems. This is negligible in view of the
cosmological time delays predicted for typical lensed type-Ia supernovae
but not for the specific case of the recently discovered type-Ia
supernova {iPTF}16geu, whose time delays are expected to be smaller than a
day.},

the resolved images provides unique information about the differential
dimming due to dust in the lensing galaxy. Using {HST} and Keck {AO}
reference images taken after the {SN} faded, we obtain a total lensing
magnification for {iPTF}16geu of μ = 67.8{\textasciicircum}\{+2.6\}\_\{-2.9\}, accounting for
extinction in the host and lensing galaxy. As expected from the symmetry
of the system, we measure very short time-delays for the three fainter
images with respect to the brightest one: -0.23 ± 0.99, -1.43
± 0.74, and 1.36 ± 1.07 d. Interestingly, we find large
differences between the magnifications of the four supernova images,
even after accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections:
Δ m\_1 = -3.88{\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.06\}, Δ m\_2 =
-2.99{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}\_\{-0.08\}, Δ m\_3 = -2.19{\textasciicircum}\{+0.14\}\_\{-0.15\}, and Δ
m\_4 = -2.40{\textasciicircum}\{+0.14\}\_\{-0.12\} mag, discrepant with model predictions
suggesting similar image brightnesses. A possible explanation for the
large differences is gravitational lensing by substructures, micro- or
millilensing, in addition to the large-scale lens causing the image
separations. We find that the inferred magnification is insensitive to
the assumptions about the dust properties in the host and lens galaxy.},

Here, refined observations of {iPTF}16geu, including the time delay between images, are used to decrease uncertainties in the lens model, including the the slope of the projected surface density of the lens galaxy, Σ
∝ r1 ‑ η, and to constrain the universal
expansion rate H0. Imaging with Hubble Space Telescope provides an upper limit on the slope η, in slight tension with the steeper density profiles indicated by imaging with Keck after {iPTF}16geu had faded, potentially due to dust extinction not corrected for in host galaxy imaging. Since smaller η implies larger magnifications, we take advantage of the standard candle nature of {SNe} Ia constraining the image magnifications, to obtain an independent constraint of the slope. We find that a smooth lens density fails to explain the {iPTF}16geu fluxes, regardless of the slope, and additional substructure lensing is needed. The total probability for the smooth halo model combined with star microlensing to explain the {iPTF}16geu image fluxes is maximized at 12 per cent for η ∼ 1.8, in excellent agreement with Keck
high-spatial-resolution data, and flatter than an isothermal halo. It also agrees perfectly with independent constraints on the slope from lens velocity dispersion measurements. Combining with the observed time delays between the images, we infer a lower bound on the Hubble
constant, \$H\_0 {\textbackslash}gtrsim 40{\textbackslash}, \{{\textbackslash}rm km {\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ , at 68.3 per cent confidence level.},

	abstract = {We report the results from spectroscopic observations of the multiple images of the strongly lensed Type Ia supernova ({SN} Ia), {iPTF}16geu, obtained with ground based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}). From a single epoch of slitless spectroscopy with {HST}, we can resolve spectra of individual lensed supernova images for the first time. This allows us to perform an independent measurement of the time-delay between the two brightest images, \${\textbackslash}Delta t = 1.4 {\textbackslash}pm 5.0\$ days, which is consistent with the time-delay measured from the
light-curves. We also present measurements of narrow emission and absorption lines characterizing the interstellar medium in the host galaxy at z=0.4087, as well as in the foreground lensing galaxy at z=0.2163. We detect strong Na {ID} absorption in the host galaxy,
indicating that {iPTF}16geu belongs to a subclass of {SNe} Ia displaying "anomalously" large Na {ID} column densities in comparison to the amount of dust extinction derived from their light curves. For the deflecting galaxy, we refine the measurement of the velocity dispersion, \${\textbackslash}sigma = 129 {\textbackslash}pm 4\$ km/s, which significantly constrains the lens model. Since the time-delay between the {SN} images is negligible, we can use
unresolved ground based spectroscopy, boosted by a factor {\textasciitilde}70 from lensing magnification, to study the properties of a high-z {SN} Ia with unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio. The spectral properties of the supernova, such as pseudo-Equivalent widths of several absorption features and velocities of the Si {II}-line indicate that {iPTF}16geu, besides being lensed, is a normal {SN} Ia, indistinguishable from
well-studied ones in the local universe, providing support for the use of {SNe} Ia in precision cosmology. We do not detect any significant deviations of the {SN} spectral energy distribution from microlensing of the {SN} photosphere by stars and compact objects in the lensing galaxy.},

	abstract = {Significant observational effort has been devoted to determining volumetric type Ia supernova rates at high redshifts, leading to clues about the nature of Ia supernova progenitors and constraints on the iron production in the universe. A complementary approach is to investigate type Ia supernova rates in individual, more nearby, galaxies. The popular A + B model for the specific supernova rate, while reliable for a wide range of galaxy properties, diverges for large specific star formation rates. Applying it outside its range of validity could lead to the prediction of excessive type Ia supernova rates. Moreover, the A + B model it is not directly derived from a delay time distribution. We here introduce a new model which is explicitly motivated by a simple delay time distribution composed of a prompt and a delayed component. The model is in remarkably good agreement with current observational constraints. It yields a prompt fraction of f\_\{ p\}= 0.11{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\}\_\{-0.06\} in agreement with results based on volumetric rates of type Ia
supernovae at high redshift. The model is tested against realistic star formation rates from the Illustris-1 simulation and is found to be self-consistent in the asymptotic limits. An analytic function that encapsulates the features of the new model is shown to be in excellent agreement with the data. In terms of goodness of fit, the new model is strongly preferred over the A + B model. At log ({sSFR}) ≳ -9 there are no constraints from observations. Observations in this regime will further constrain the delay time distribution of type Ia supernovae at short delay times.},

Gravitationally lensed examples provide a promising route forward, but
such objects are very rare. We describe a search in the fields of 232
galaxy clusters that has uncovered five bright (H {AB} {\textless} 20)
lensed galaxies with red near-infrared colors. These include {MRG}-M0138,
which is the brightest lensed galaxy known in the near-infrared.
Analysis of near-infrared spectra and multiband photometry confirms that
all are quiescent galaxies at z = 1.95-2.64 with stellar ages of
0.5-1.4 Gyr (corresponding to formation epochs z form
≃ 3-4) and stellar masses of \{10\}11.6-12.8 \{μ
\}-1 \{M\}⊙ , where μ is the magnification.
In three cases, we derive lens models and reconstruct the source
structure; these galaxies are massive (\{M\}* ≳
\{10\}11.0 \{M\}⊙ ) and follow the
mass-size relation defined by unlensed samples. In two of these
three galaxies, the main structural component is an inclined disk. Weak
emission lines are detected in four of five galaxies with high ratios [N
{II}]/Hα ≃ 2-6 that are inconsistent with a star
formation origin. Based on the line ratios, the Hα equivalent
widths, and the distribution and kinematics of the gas, we infer that
shocks are likely to be present in at least two galaxies and could be
present in all of the line emitters. We speculate that these could be
analogs of local galaxies in which {AGN} jet-driven outflows are thought
to heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. In further

high-quality spectra (two or more spectral features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects, we could not obtain reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at I {AB} ∼ 23 and K {AB} ∼
21, with a secondary peak at K {AB} ∼ 24. We sample a broad redshift distribution in the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, with one peak at z ∼ 1, and another one around z ∼ 4. We have identified 13
redshift spikes at z {\textgreater} 0.65 with chance probabilities {\textless} 4 ×

spectroscopic failures and relative redshift accuracy. We have
determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to about 0.8\% in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well below the most pessimistic expectations.

measurements of the observed rates of supernovae ({SNe}) in the local
Universe, determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search ({LOSS}).
In this paper, a complete {SN} sample is constructed, and the observed
(uncorrected for host-galaxy extinction) luminosity functions ({LFs}) of
{SNe} are derived. These {LFs} solve two issues that have plagued previous
rate calculations for nearby {SNe}: the luminosity distribution of {SNe} and
the host-galaxy extinction. We select a volume-limited sample of 175
{SNe}, collect photometry for every object and fit a family of light
curves to constrain the peak magnitudes and light-curve shapes. The
volume-limited {LFs} show that they are not well represented by a Gaussian
distribution. There are notable differences in the {LFs} for galaxies of
different Hubble types (especially for {SNe} Ia). We derive the observed
fractions for the different subclasses in a complete {SN} sample, and find
significant fractions of {SNe} {II}-L (10 per cent), {IIb} (12 per cent) and
{IIn} (9 per cent) in the {SN} {II} sample. Furthermore, we derive the {LFs} and
the observed fractions of different {SN} subclasses in a magnitude-limited
survey with different observation intervals, and find that the {LFs} are
enhanced at the high-luminosity end and appear more `standard' with
smaller scatter, and that the {LFs} and fractions of {SNe} do not change
significantly when the observation interval is shorter than 10 d. We
also discuss the {LFs} in different galaxy sizes and inclinations, and for
different {SN} subclasses. Some notable results are that there is not a
strong correlation between the {SN} {LFs} and the host-galaxy size, but
there might be a preference for {SNe} {IIn} to occur in small, late-type
spiral galaxies. The {LFs} in different inclination bins do not provide
strong evidence for extreme extinction in highly inclined galaxies,
though the sample is still small. The {LFs} of different {SN} subclasses
show significant differences. We also find that {SNe} Ibc and {IIb} come
from more luminous galaxies than {SNe} {II}-P, while {SNe} {IIn} come from less
luminous galaxies, suggesting a possible metallicity effect. The
limitations and applications of our {LFs} are also discussed.},

	abstract = {This is the third paper of a series in which we present new measurements 
of the observed rates of supernovae ({SNe}) in the local Universe,
determined from the Lick Observatory Supernova Search ({LOSS}). We have
considered a sample of ∼1000 {SNe} and used an optimal subsample of
726 {SNe} (274 {SNe} Ia, 116 {SNe} Ibc and 324 {SNe} {II}) to determine our rates.
We study the trend of the rates as a function of a few quantities
available for our galaxy sample, such as luminosity in the B and K
bands, stellar mass and morphological class. We discuss different
choices ({SN} samples, input {SN} luminosity functions, inclination
correction factors) and their effect on the rates and their
uncertainties. A comparison between our {SN} rates and the published
measurements shows that they are consistent with each other to within
the uncertainties when the rate calculations are done in the same
manner. Nevertheless, our data demonstrate that the rates cannot be
adequately described by a single parameter using either galaxy Hubble
types or B-K colours. A secondary parameter in galaxy 'size', expressed
by luminosity or stellar mass, is needed to adequately describe the
rates in the rate-size relation: the galaxies of smaller sizes have
higher {SN} rates per unit mass or per unit luminosity. The trends of the
{SN} rates in galaxies of different Hubble types and colours are
discussed. We examine possible causes for the rate-size relation.
Physically, such a relation for the core-collapse {SNe} is probably linked
to the correlation between the specific star-formation rate and the
galaxy sizes, but it is not clear whether the same link can be
established for {SNe} Ia. We discuss the two-component ('tardy' and
'prompt') model for {SN} Ia rates, and find that the {SN} Ia rates in young
stellar populations might have a strong correlation with the
core-collapse {SN} rates. We derive volumetric rates for the different {SN}
types [e.g. for {SNe} Ia, a rate of (0.301 ± 0.062) ×
10-4 {SN} Mpc-3 yr-1 at redshift 0] and
compare them to the measurements at different redshifts. Finally, we
estimate the {SN} rate for the Milky Way Galaxy to be 2.84 ± 0.60
{SNe} per century (with a systematic uncertainty of a factor of ∼2),
consistent with published {SN} rates based on several different
techniques.},

could match a wide range of physically motivated {DTD} forms. We find a
family of solutions that are essentially exponential {DTDs}, similar in
shape to the β ≈ ‑1 power-law {DTDs}, but with more delayed
events ({\textgreater}1 Gyr in age) than prompt events ({\textless}1 Gyr). Comparing
these solutions to delay time measures separately derived from field
galaxies and galaxy clusters, we find the skew-normal solutions can
accommodate both without requiring a different {DTD} form in different
environments. These model fits are generally inconsistent with results
from single-degenerate binary population synthesis models, and are
seemingly supportive of double-degenerate progenitors for most {SN} Ia

	abstract = {We study possible systematic effects on the values of the cosmological 
parameters measured through strong lensing analyses of the {HFF} galaxy
cluster {MACS} J1149.5+2223. We use the observed positions of a large set
of spectroscopically selected multiple images, including those of
supernova "Refsdal" with their estimated time delays. Starting from our
reference model in a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology, published in Grillo et
al. (2018), we confirm the relevance of the longest measurable time
delay, between {SX} and S1, and an approximately linear relation between
its value and that of \$H\_\{0\}\$. We perform true blind tests by
considering a range of time delays around its original estimate of \$345
{\textbackslash}pm 10\$ days, as an accurate measurement of this time delay was not
known at the time of analysis and writing. We investigate separately the
impact of a constant sheet of mass at the cluster redshift, of a
power-law profile for the mass density of the cluster main halo and of
some scatter in the cluster member scaling relations. Remarkably, we
find that these systematic effects do not introduce a significant bias
on the inferred values of \$H\_\{0\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$ and that the
statistical uncertainties dominate the total error budget: a 3\%
uncertainty on the time delay of image {SX} translates into approximately
6\% and 40\% (including both statistical and systematic \$1{\textbackslash}sigma\$)
uncertainties for \$H\_\{0\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}\$, respectively.
Furthermore, our model accurately reproduces the extended surface
brightness distribution of the supernova host, covering more than \$3
{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ \${HST}\$ pixels. We also present the interesting possibility
of measuring the value of the equation-of-state parameter \$w\$ of the
dark energy density, currently with a 30\% uncertainty. We conclude that
time-delay cluster lenses have the potential to become soon an
alternative and competitive cosmological probe.},

	abstract = {We present the {HOLISMOKES} project on strong gravitational lensing of

the effects of microlensing on early-phase {SN} Ia spectra, and find that
within 10 rest-frame days after {SN} explosion, distortions of {SN} Ia
spectra due to microlensing are typically negligible ({\textless}1\% distortion
within the 68\% credible region, and {\textasciitilde}10\% distortion within the 95\%
credible region). This shows great prospects of using lensed {SNe} Ia to
obtain intrinsic early-phase {SN} spectra for deciphering {SN} Ia
progenitors. As a demonstration of the usefulness of lensed {SNe} Ia for
cosmology, we simulate a sample of mock lensed {SN} Ia systems that are
expected to have accurate and precise time-delay measurements in the era
of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time ({LSST}). Adopting realistic yet
conservative uncertainties on their time-delay distances and lens
angular diameter distances (of 6.6\% and 5\%, respectively), we find that
a sample of 20 lensed {SNe} Ia would allow a constraint on the Hubble
constant (\$H\_0\$) with 1.3\% uncertainty in the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}

	abstract = {{CMB} observables have largely fixed the expansion history of the universe in the deceleration regime and provided two self-calibrated absolute standards for dark energy studies: the sound horizon at recombination as a standard ruler and the amplitude of initial density fluctuations.  We review these inferences and expose the testable assumptions about recombination and reionization that underly them.  Fixing the
deceleration regime with {CMB} observables, deviations in the distance and growth observables appear most strongly at z=0 implying that accurate calibration of local and {CMB} standards may be more important than redshift range or depth.  The single most important complement to the {CMB} for measuring the dark energy equation of state at z ˜ 0.5 is a determination of the Hubble constant to better than a few percent. Counterintuitively, with fixed fractional distance errors and relative standards such as {SNe}, the Hubble constant measurement is best achieved in the high redshift deceleration regime. Degeneracies between the evolution and current value of the equation of state or between its value and spatial curvature can be broken if percent level measurement and calibration of distance standards can be made at intermediate redshifts or the growth function at any redshift in the acceleration regime.   We compare several dark energy probes available to a wide and deep optical survey: baryon features in galaxy angular power spectra and the growth rate from galaxy-galaxy lensing, shear tomography and the cluster abundance.},

(±2.4\% sys) km s-1 Mpc-1. The
{TRGB} method is both precise and accurate and is parallel to but
independent of the Cepheid distance scale. Our value sits midway in the
range defined by the current Hubble tension. It agrees at the 1.2σ
level with that of the Planck Collaboration et al. estimate and at the
1.7σ level with the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) {SHoES} measurement
of H 0 based on the Cepheid distance scale. The {TRGB}
distances have been measured using deep {HST} Advanced Camera for Surveys
imaging of galaxy halos. The zero-point of the {TRGB} calibration is set
with a distance modulus to the Large Magellanic Cloud of 18.477 ±
0.004 (stat) ± 0.020 (sys) mag, based on measurement of 20
late-type detached eclipsing binary stars, combined with an {HST} parallax
calibration of a 3.6 μm Cepheid Leavitt law based on Spitzer
observations. We anchor the {TRGB} distances to galaxies that extend our
measurement into the Hubble flow using the recently completed Carnegie
Supernova Project I ( {CSP}-I ) sample containing about 100 well-observed
{SNe} Ia . There are several advantages of halo {TRGB} distance measurements
relative to Cepheid variables; these include low halo reddening, minimal
effects of crowding or blending of the photometry, only a shallow
(calibrated) sensitivity to metallicity in the I band, and no need for
multiple epochs of observations or concerns of different slopes with
period. In addition, the host masses of our {TRGB} host-galaxy sample are
higher, on average, than those of the Cepheid sample, better matching
the range of host-galaxy masses in the {CSP}-I distant sample and reducing
potential systematic effects in the {SNe} Ia measurements.

correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field
reconstruction of the {BAO} feature. The acoustic features are detected at
a significance of over 7σ in both the correlation function and
power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features
measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch,
rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in

	abstract = {Aims: We present cosmological constraints from a joint analysis 
of type Ia supernova ({SN} Ia) observations obtained by the {SDSS}-{II} and
{SNLS} collaborations. The dataset includes several low-redshift samples
(z{\textless} 0.1), all three seasons from the {SDSS}-{II} (0.05 Methods: We followed the methods and assumptions of the
{SNLS} three-year data analysis except for the following important
improvements: 1) the addition of the full {SDSS}-{II}
spectroscopically-confirmed {SN} Ia sample in both the training of the
{SALT}2 light-curve model and in the Hubble diagram analysis (374 {SNe}); 2)
intercalibration of the {SNLS} and {SDSS} surveys and reduced systematic
uncertainties in the photometric calibration, performed blindly with
respect to the cosmology analysis; and 3) a thorough investigation of
systematic errors associated with the {SALT}2 modeling of {SN} Ia light
curves. Results: We produce recalibrated {SN} Ia light curves and
associated distances for the {SDSS}-{II} and {SNLS} samples. The large {SDSS}-{II}
sample provides an effective, independent, low-z anchor for the Hubble
diagram and reduces the systematic error from calibration systematics in
the low-z {SN} sample. For a flat Λ{CDM} cosmology, we find
Ωm =0.295 ± 0.034 (stat+sys), a value consistent
with the most recent cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) measurement from
the Planck and {WMAP} experiments. Our result is 1.8σ (stat+sys)
different than the previously published result of {SNLS} three-year data.
The change is due primarily to improvements in the {SNLS} photometric
calibration. When combined with {CMB} constraints, we measure a constant
dark-energy equation of state parameter w =-1.018 ± 0.057
(stat+sys) for a flat universe. Adding baryon acoustic oscillation
distance measurements gives similar constraints: w =-1.027 ±
0.055. Our supernova measurements provide the most stringent constraints
to date on the nature of dark energy.

	abstract = {Time delays of gravitationally lensed sources can be used to constrain 
the mass model of a deflector and determine cosmological parameters. We
here present an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply
imaged sources behind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with
well-calibrated mass models. We find that for time delays less than 1000
days, at z = 3.0, their logarithmic probability distribution functions
are well represented by P(log Δt) = 5.3 ×
10-4Δttilde
beta/M2502tilde beta, with tilde beta =
0.77, where M250 is the projected cluster mass inside 250 kpc
(in 1014M⊙), and tilde beta is the power-law
slope of the distribution. The resultant probability distribution
function enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensing
cluster of known mass. For a cluster with M250 = 2 ×
1014M⊙, the fraction of time delays less
than 1000 days is approximately 3\%. Taking Abell 1689 as an example, its
dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity dispersions
σ{\textgreater}=500kms-1, mainly produce large time delays,
while galaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller
time delays. We estimate the probability of observing multiple images of
a supernova in the known images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of
estimating the supernova rate is applied in this work. For a magnitude
threshold of {mAB} = 26.5, the yearly rate of Type Ia
(core-collapse) supernovae with time delays less than 1000 days is
0.004±0.002 (0.029±0.001). If the magnitude threshold is
lowered to {mAB} {\textasciitilde} 27.0, the rate of core-collapse supernovae
suitable for time delay observation is 0.044±0.015 per year.},

increase.   This set can be added to the known lens sample to tackle the
cosmologically significant problems of studying substructures in dark

the base of time domain astronomy. Due to the varying seeing conditions,
the image subtraction process is non-trivial, and existing solutions
suffer from a variety of problems. Starting from basic statistical
principles, we develop the optimal statistic for transient detection,
flux measurement, and any image-difference hypothesis testing. We derive
a closed-form statistic that: (1) is mathematically proven to be the
optimal transient detection statistic in the limit of
background-dominated noise, (2) is numerically stable, (3) for
accurately registered, adequately sampled images, does not leave
subtraction or deconvolution artifacts, (4) allows automatic transient
detection to the theoretical sensitivity limit by providing credible
detection significance, (5) has uncorrelated white noise, (6) is a
sufficient statistic for any further statistical test on the difference
image, and, in particular, allows us to distinguish particle hits and
other image artifacts from real transients, (7) is symmetric to the
exchange of the new and reference images, (8) is at least an order of
magnitude faster to compute than some popular methods, and (9) is
straightforward to implement. Furthermore, we present extensions of this
method that make it resilient to registration errors, color-refraction
errors, and any noise source that can be modeled. In addition, we show
that the optimal way to prepare a reference image is the proper image
coaddition presented in Zackay \& Ofek. We demonstrate this method on
simulated data and real observations from the {PTF} data release 2. We
provide an implementation of this algorithm in {MATLAB} and Python.},

photometric system used to measure extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts
of {SNe} Ia. Gyroscopic control of {HST} was employed to reduce overheads
while collecting a large sample of widely separated Cepheids. The
Cepheid period-luminosity relation provides a
zero-point-independent link with 0.4\% precision between the new 1.2\%
geometric distance to the {LMC} from detached eclipsing binaries ({DEBs})
measured by Pietrzyński et al. and the luminosity of {SNe} Ia.
Measurements and analysis of the {LMC} Cepheids were completed prior to
knowledge of the new {DEB} {LMC} distance. Combined with a refined
calibration of the count-rate linearity of {WFC}3-{IR} with 0.1\% precision,
these three improved elements together reduce the overall uncertainty in
the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance ladder based on the
{LMC} from 2.5\% to 1.3\%. Using only the {LMC} {DEBs} to calibrate the ladder,
we find H 0 = 74.22 ± 1.82 km s-1
Mpc-1 including systematic uncertainties, 3\% higher
than before for this particular anchor. Combining the {LMC} {DEBs}, masers
in {NGC} 4258, and Milky Way parallaxes yields our best estimate: H
0 = 74.03 ± 1.42 km s-1

1.91\%-15\% lower than our best previous result. Removing any one of
these anchors changes H 0 by less than 0.7\%. The difference
between H 0 measured locally and the value inferred from
Planck {CMB} and Λ{CDM} is 6.6 ± 1.5 km s-1
Mpc-1 or 4.4σ (P = 99.999\% for Gaussian errors)

chance. We summarize independent tests showing that this discrepancy is

Our model includes 12 new multiply imaged galaxies, bringing the total to 22, composed of 65 individual lensed images. Unlike the first two {HFF} clusters, Abell 2744 and {MACS} J0416.1-2403, {MACS} J1149 does not reveal as many multiple images in the {HFF} data. Using the {LENSTOOL} software package and the new sets of multiple images, we model the cluster with several cluster-scale dark matter haloes and additional galaxy-scale haloes for the cluster members. Consistent with previous analyses, we find the system to be complex, composed of five cluster-scale haloes. Their spatial distribution and lower mass, however, makes {MACS} J1149 a less powerful lens. Our best-fitting model predicts image positions with an rms of 0.91 arcsec.

	volume = {1911},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191111760S},
	abstract = {The Hubble tension can be significantly eased if there is an early 
component of dark energy that becomes active around the time of
matter-radiation equality. Early dark energy models suffer from a
coincidence problem---the physics of matter-radiation equality and early
dark energy are completely disconnected, so some degree of fine-tuning
is needed in order for them to occur nearly simultaneously. In this
paper we propose a natural explanation for this coincidence. If the
early dark energy scalar couples to neutrinos then it receives a large
injection of energy around the time that neutrinos become
non-relativistic. This is precisely when their temperature is of order

natural trigger for early dark energy by displacing the field from its
minimum just before matter-radiation equality. We discuss various

H0=72.1-1.7+1.5 km /s /Mpc , when Neff is free to vary), the σ8 parameter
remains too large to reduce the σ8 tension. Adding high multipole Planck polarization data does not help since this data shows a strong preference for low values of H0, thus worsening current tensions, even though they also prefer smaller value of

We explore both Gaussian process ({GP}) and template methods for fitting the {LCs} and estimating distances, while including peculiar-velocity and photometric uncertainties. For the 56 {SNe} Ia with both optical and {NIR} observations near maximum light, the {GP} method yields a {NIR}-only Hubble-diagram with a root mean square (rms) of 0.117 +/-  0.014 mag when referenced to the {NIR} maxima. For each {NIR} band, a comparable {GP} method rms is obtained when referencing to {NIR}-max or B-max. Using {NIR} {LC} templates referenced to B-max yields a larger rms value of 0.138 +/- 0.014 mag. Fitting the corresponding optical data using standard {LC} fitters that use {LC} shape and color corrections yields larger rms values of 0.179 ± 0.018 mag with {SALT}2 and 0.174 +/-  0.021 mag with
{SNooPy}. Applying our {GP} method to subsets of {SNe} Ia {NIR} {LCs} at {NIR} maximum light, even without corrections for {LC} shape, color, or
host-galaxy dust reddening, provides smaller rms in the inferred distances, at the ∼2.3–4.1σ level, than standard optical
methods that correct for those effects. Our ongoing {RAISIN} program on the Hubble Space Telescope will exploit this promising infrared approach to limit systematic errors when measuring the expansion history of the universe in order to constrain dark energy.},

This will provide an independent and direct way for measuring the Hubble
constant H0, which is necessary to address the current
4.4σ tension in H0 between the local distance ladder
and the early Universe measurements. We present a detailed analysis of
different observing strategies (also referred to as cadence strategy)
for the {LSST}, and quantify their impact on time-delay measurement
between multiple images of {LSNe} Ia. For this, we simulated observations
by using mock {LSNe} Ia for which we produced mock-{LSST} light curves that
account for microlensing. Furthermore, we used the free-knot splines
estimator from the software {PyCS} to measure the time delay from the
simulated observations. We find that using only {LSST} data for time-delay
cosmography is not ideal. Instead, we advocate using {LSST} as a discovery
machine for {LSNe} Ia, enabling time delay measurements from follow-up
observations from other instruments in order to increase the number of
systems by a factor of 2-16 depending on the observing strategy.
Furthermore, we find that {LSST} observing strategies, which provide a
good sampling frequency (the mean inter-night gap is around two days)
and high cumulative season length (ten seasons with a season length of
around 170 days per season), are favored. Rolling cadences subdivide the
survey and focus on different parts in different years; these observing
strategies trade the number of seasons for better sampling frequency. In
our investigation, this leads to half the number of systems in
comparison to the best observing strategy. Therefore rolling cadences
are disfavored because the gain from the increased sampling frequency
cannot compensate for the shortened cumulative season length. We
anticipate that the sample of lensed {SNe} Ia from our preferred {LSST}
cadence strategies with rapid follow-up observations would yield an
independent percent-level constraint on H0.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral image ({HSI}) classification is widely used for the analysis 
of remotely sensed images. Hyperspectral imagery includes varying bands
of images. Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) is one of the most
frequently used deep learning based methods for visual data processing.
The use of {CNN} for {HSI} classification is also visible in recent works.
These approaches are mostly based on 2D {CNN}. Whereas, the {HSI}
classification performance is highly dependent on both spatial and
spectral information. Very few methods have utilized the 3D {CNN} because
of increased computational complexity. This letter proposes a Hybrid
Spectral Convolutional Neural Network ({HybridSN}) for {HSI} classification.
Basically, the {HybridSN} is a spectral-spatial 3D-{CNN} followed by spatial
2D-{CNN}. The 3D-{CNN} facilitates the joint spatial-spectral feature
representation from a stack of spectral bands. The 2D-{CNN} on top of the
3D-{CNN} further learns more abstract level spatial representation.
Moreover, the use of hybrid {CNNs} reduces the complexity of the model
compared to 3D-{CNN} alone. To test the performance of this hybrid
approach, very rigorous {HSI} classification experiments are performed
over Indian Pines, Pavia University and Salinas Scene remote sensing
datasets. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art
hand-crafted as well as end-to-end deep learning based methods. A very
satisfactory performance is obtained using the proposed {HybridSN} for {HSI}
classification. The source code can be found at

7 that have star-formation histories ({SFHs}) derived with the {VErsatile}
{SPectral} Analysis code ({VESPA}). We use the {SN} Ia sample to measure {SN} Ia
rates per unit stellar mass. We confirm, at the median redshift of the
sample, z = 0.1, the inverse dependence on galaxy mass of the {SN} Ia rate
per unit mass, previously reported by Li et al. for a local sample. We
further confirm, following Kistler et al., that this relation can be
explained by the combination of galaxy `downsizing' and a power-law
delay-time distribution ({DTD}; the distribution of times that elapse
between a hypothetical burst of star formation and the subsequent {SN} Ia
explosions) with an index of -1, inherent to the double-degenerate
progenitor scenario. We use the method of Maoz et al. to recover the {DTD}
by comparing the number of {SNe} Ia hosted by each galaxy in our sample
with the {VESPA}-derived {SFH} of the stellar population within the spectral
aperture. In this galaxy sample, which is dominated by old and massive

techniques, in combination with Machine Learning ({ML}) algorithms,
applied to the identification of optical transients associated to
gravitational wave events. Each technique is assessed based on the
scoring metrics of Precision, Recall, and their harmonic mean F 1 ,
measured on the {DIA} results as standalone techniques, and also in the
results after the application of {ML} algorithms, on transient source
injections over simulated and real data. These simulations cover a wide
range of instrumental configurations, as well as a variety of scenarios
of observation conditions, by exploring a multi dimensional set of
relevant parameters, allowing us to extract general conclusions related
to the identification of transient astrophysical events.

The newest subtraction techniques, and particularly the methodology
published in Zackay et al., (2016) are implemented on an Open Source
Python package, named properimage, suitable for many other astronomical
image analyses. This together, with the {ML} libraries we describe,
provides an effective transient detection software pipeline. Here we
study the effects of the different {ML} techniques, and the relative
feature importances for classification of transient candidates, and
propose an optimal combined strategy. This constitutes the basic
elements of pipelines that could be applied in searches of
electromagnetic counterparts to {GW} sources.},

Due to their role neutrinos carry information from the heart of the explosion and, due to their weakly interacting nature, offer the only direct probe of the dynamics and thermodynamics at the center of a supernova. In this paper, we review the present status of modelling the neutrino physics and signal formation in collapsing and exploding stars. We assess the capability of current and planned large underground neutrino detectors to yield faithful
information of the time and flavor-dependent neutrino signal from a future Galactic supernova. We show how the observable neutrino burst would provide a benchmark for fundamental supernova physics with unprecedented richness of detail. Exploiting the treasure of the measured neutrino events requires a careful discrimination of
source-generated properties from signal features that originate on the way to the detector. As for the latter, we discuss self-induced flavor conversions associated with neutrino-neutrino interactions that occur in the deepest stellar regions; matter effects that modify the pattern of flavor conversions in the dynamical stellar envelope;
neutrino-oscillation signatures that result from structural features associated with the shock-wave propagation as well as turbulent mass motions in post-shock layers. Finally, we highlight our current
understanding of the formation of the diffuse supernova neutrino background and we analyse the perspectives for a detection of this relic signal that integrates the contributions from all past core-collapse supernovae in the Universe.},

With the recent measurement of H0 this tension has raised to more than 3 σ. We consider changes in the early time physics without modifying the late time cosmology. We also reconstruct the late time expansion history in a model independent way with minimal assumptions using distance measurements from Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Type Ia Supernovae, finding that at z {\textless} 0.6 the recovered shape of the
expansion history is less than 5\% different than that of a standard Λ{CDM} model. These probes also provide a model insensitive
constraint on the low-redshift standard ruler, measuring directly the combination rsh where H0 = h × 100
Mpc-1km/s and rs is the sound horizon at
radiation drag (the standard ruler), traditionally constrained by {CMB} observations. Thus rs and H0 provide absolute scales for distance measurements (anchors) at opposite ends of the observable Universe. We calibrate the cosmic distance ladder and obtain a model-independent determination of the standard ruler for acoustic scale, rs. The tension in H0 reflects a mismatch between our determination of rs and its standard,
{CMB}-inferred value. Without including high-l Planck {CMB} polarization data (i.e., only considering the ``recommended baseline" low-l
polarisation and temperature and the high l temperature data), a modification of the early-time physics to include a component of dark radiation with an effective number of species around 0.4 would reconcile the {CMB}-inferred constraints, and the local H0 and standard ruler determinations. The inclusion of the ``preliminary" high-l Planck {CMB} polarisation data disfavours this solution.},

	abstract = {Most massive stars, the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae, are in 
close binary systems and may interact with their companion through mass
transfer or merging. We undertake a population synthesis study to
compute the delay-time distribution of core-collapse supernovae, that
is, the supernova rate versus time following a starburst, taking into
account binary interactions. We test the systematic robustness of our
results by running various simulations to account for the uncertainties
in our standard assumptions. We find that a significant fraction, \%, of
core-collapse supernovae are "late", that is, they occur 50-200 Myr
after birth, when all massive single stars have already exploded. These
late events originate predominantly from binary systems with at least
one, or, in most cases, with both stars initially being of intermediate
mass (4-8 M⊙). The main evolutionary channels that
contribute often involve either the merging of the initially more
massive primary star with its companion or the engulfment of the
remaining core of the primary by the expanding secondary that has
accreted mass at an earlier evolutionary stage. Also, the total number
of core-collapse supernovae increases by \% because of binarity for the
same initial stellar mass. The high rate implies that we should have
already observed such late core-collapse supernovae, but have not
recognized them as such. We argue that φ Persei is a likely
progenitor and that eccentric neutron star - white dwarf systems are
likely descendants. Late events can help explain the discrepancy in the
delay-time distributions derived from supernova remnants in the
Magellanic Clouds and extragalactic type Ia events, lowering the
contribution of prompt Ia events. We discuss ways to test these
predictions and speculate on the implications for supernova feedback in
simulations of galaxy evolution.},

empirical iron yields of the various {SN} types, we re-derive the cosmic

about equally to the total mass of iron in the universe today. We find
the track of the average cosmic gas element in the [α/Fe] versus
[Fe/H] abundance-ratio plane. The track is broadly similar to the
observed main locus of Galactic stars in this plane, indicating a Milky
Way ({MW}) {SFH} similar in form to the cosmic one. We easily find a simple
{MW} {SFH} that makes the track closely match this stellar locus. Galaxy
clusters appear to have a higher-normalization {DTD}. This cluster {DTD},
combined with a short-burst {MW} {SFH} peaked at z = 3, produces a track
that matches remarkably well the observed “high-α”

While much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function, is a key tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution. The past decade has seen a growing variety of methods for measuring or inferring the initial mass function. This range of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting conclusions regarding whether or not the initial mass function is universal. Here I review this growing wealth of approaches, and highlight the importance of considering potential initial mass function variations, reinforcing the need to carefully quantify the scope and uncertainties of
measurements. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the initial mass function and promote clarity in the further development of this fundamental field.},

However, the specific progenitor systems of {SNe} Ia, and the processes that lead to their ignition, have not been identified. Two broad classes of progenitor binary systems have long been considered:
single-degenerate ({SD}), in which a {WD} gains mass from a nondegenerate star; and double-degenerate ({DD}), involving the merger of two {WDs}. New theoretical work has enriched these possibilities with some interesting updates and variants. We review the significant recent observational progress in addressing the progenitor problem. We consider clues that have emerged from the observed properties of the various proposed progenitor populations, from studies of {SN} Ia sites—pre- and
postexplosion—from analysis of the explosions themselves and from the measurement of event rates. The recent nearby and well-studied event, {SN} 2011fe, has been particularly revealing. The observational results are not yet conclusive and sometimes prone to competing
theoretical interpretations. Nevertheless, it appears that {DD}
progenitors, long considered the underdog option, could be behind some, if not all, {SNe} Ia. We point to some directions that may lead to future progress.},

energies approaching 1053 erg, these supernovae are expected
to be within the detection limits of the upcoming James Webb Space
Telescope ({JWST}), allowing observational constraints to be placed on the
properties of the first stars. We estimate the source density of {PISNe}
using a semi-analytic halo mass function based approach, accounting for
the effects of feedback from star formation on the {PISN} rate using
cosmological simulations. We estimate an upper limit of {\textasciitilde}0.2 {PISNe} per
{JWST} field of view at any given time. Feedback can reduce this rate
significantly, e.g., lowering it to as little as one {PISN} per 4000 {JWST}
fields of view for the most pessimistic explosion models. We also find
that the main obstacle to observing {PISNe} from the first stars is their
scarcity, not their faintness; exposures longer than a few times
104 s will do little to increase the number of {PISNe} found.
Given this, we suggest a mosaic style search strategy for detecting
{PISNe} from the first stars. Even rather high-redshift {PISNe} are unlikely
to be missed by moderate exposures, and a large number of pointings will
be required to ensure a detection.},

	abstract = {Large synoptic (repeated scan) imaging sky surveys are poised to observe enormous numbers of core-collapse supernovae. We quantify the discovery potential of such surveys, and apply our results to upcoming projects, including {DES}, Pan-{STARRS}, and {LSST}. The latter two will harvest core-collapse supernovae in numbers orders of magnitude greater than have ever been observed to date. These surveys will map out the cosmic core-collapse supernova redshift distribution via direct counting, with very small statistical uncertainties out to a redshift depth which is a strong function of the survey limiting magnitude. This supernova redshift history encodes rich information about cosmology, star
formation, and supernova astrophysics and phenomenology; the large statistics of the supernova sample will be crucial to disentangle possible degeneracies among these issues. For example, the cosmic supernova rate can be measured to high precision out to z {\textasciitilde} 0.5 for all core-collapse types, and out to redshift z {\textasciitilde} 1 for Type {IIn} events if their intrinsic properties remain the same as those measured locally. A precision knowledge of the cosmic supernova rate would remove the cosmological uncertainties in the study of the wealth of observable properties of the cosmic supernova populations and their evolution with environment and redshift. Because of the tight link between supernovae and star formation, synoptic sky surveys will also provide precision measurements of the normalization and z lap 1 history of cosmic
star-formation rate in a manner independent of and complementary to than current data based on {UV} and other proxies for massive star formation. Furthermore, Type {II} supernovae can serve as distance indicators and would independently cross-check Type Ia distances measured in the same surveys. Arguably the largest and least-controlled uncertainty in all of these efforts comes from the poorly-understood evolution of dust obscuration of supernovae in their host galaxies; we outline a strategy to determine empirically the obscuration properties by leveraging the large supernova samples over a broad range of redshift. We conclude with recommendations on how best to use (and to tailor) these galaxy surveys to fully extract unique new probes on the physics, astrophysics, and cosmology of core-collapse explosions.},

parameterized the {CSFH} by two parameters, α and β, which are
the evolutionary indices [{\textasciitilde}(1+z)\{α,β\}] at z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1
and {\textless}{\textasciitilde}1, respectively, and quantitatively examined how well the three
parameters (α, β, and τIa) can be constrained
in ongoing and future supernova surveys. We found that the type
classification of detected supernovae down to the magnitude of
{IAB}{\textasciitilde}27 is essential for getting a useful constraint on
β. The parameter τIa can also be constrained to
within an accuracy of {\textasciitilde}1-2 Gyr without knowing α, which is
somewhat degenerate with τIa. This might be achieved by
ground-based surveys but depends on the still highly uncertain type
classification by imaging data. More reliable classification will be
achieved by the {SNAP} mission. The supernova counts at a magnitude level
of {IAB} or {KAB}{\textasciitilde}30 will allow us to break
degeneracies between α and τIa and independently
constrain all three parameters, even without knowing supernova types.
This can be achieved by the {SNAP} and {JWST} missions, which have the
different strengths of larger statistics and reaching to higher
redshifts, respectively. The dependence of observable quantities on
survey time intervals is also quantitatively calculated and discussed.},

yr-1. Correcting problems with several of these, we conclude that even a fairly optimistic estimate is probably a further order of magnitude lower than this range, at a rate of the order of 4
deg-2 yr-1 at z{\textasciitilde}15 and 0.2 deg-2 yr-1 at z{\textasciitilde}25, both with substantial uncertainty. Although such supernovae ({SNe}) would be bright enough to be readily detectable with the {JWST} at any relevant redshift, the lower number densities derived here would likely require either a dedicated wide-angle search strategy or a serendipitous search. We expect that typically about 1 deg2 (or 500 {JWST} {NIRCam} images) at 4.5 μm must be imaged to detect one {PISN} at z{\textasciitilde}15 and about 35 deg2 to detect one at z{\textasciitilde}25. If some Population {III} star formation persists to lower redshifts at z{\textasciitilde}5, then {PISNe} may also be detectable in wide-angle ground-based Z-band imaging surveys at {ZAB}{\textasciitilde}23, at a density of the order of 1 deg-2 of surveyed area. In the Appendix we consider the possible effects of intergalactic dust in obscuring high-redshift {SNe} or other high-redshift sources. We show that the obscuration at a given rest wavelength will peak at some maximum redshift and thereafter decline. While it may be a significant effect in observations of the very high redshift universe, it is unlikely, even under rather
pessimistic assumptions, to completely obscure primordial objects.},

	abstract = {Using observed star formation rates at redshifts up to z {\textasciitilde} 5, we calculate cosmic supernova rates for core collapse and Type Ia
supernovae. Together with supernova statistics and detailed light curves, we estimate the number of supernovae, and their distribution in redshift, that should be detectable in different filters with various instruments, including both existing and future telescopes, in
particular the {NGST}. We find that the {NGST} should detect several tens of core collapse supernovae in a single frame. Most of these will be core collapse supernovae with 1 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} z {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 2, but about one third will
have z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2. Rates at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 5 are highly uncertain. For ground
based 8-10 m class telescopes we predict {\textasciitilde} 0.1 supernova per square arcmin to {IAB} = 27, with about twice as many core collapse {SNe} as Type Ia's. The typical redshift will be z {\textasciitilde} 1, with an extended tail up to z {\textasciitilde} 2. Detectability of high redshift supernovae from ground is highly sensitive to the rest frame {UV} flux of the supernova, where line blanketing may decrease the rates severely in filters below 1 mu m. In addition to the standard `Madau' star formation rate, we discuss alternative models with flat star formation rate at high redshifts. Especially for supernovae at z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2 the rates of these models differ considerably, when seen as a function of redshift. An advantage of using {SNe} to study the instantaneous star formation rate is that the {SN} rest frame optical to {NIR} is less affected by dust extinction than the {UV}-light. However, if a large fraction of the star formation occurs in galaxies with a very large extinction the observed {SN} rate will be strongly affected. An additional advantage of using {SNe} is that these are not sensitive to selection effects caused by low surface brightness. Different aspects of the search strategy is discussed, and it is especially pointed out that unless the time interval between the observations spans at least 100 days for ground based searches, and one year for {NGST}, a large fraction of the Type {IIP} supernovae will be lost. Because of the time delay between the formation of the progenitor star and the explosion, observations of z {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1 Type Ia supernovae may distinguish different progenitor scenarios. A major problem is the determination of the redshift of these faint supernovae, and various alternatives are discussed, including photometric redshifts. In practice a reliable classification based on either spectroscopy or light curves requires the {SNe} to be {\textasciitilde} 2 magnitudes above the detection limit. The uncertainties in the estimates are discussed extensively. We also discuss how the estimated rates depend on cosmology. Finally, some comments on effects of metallicity are included.},

	abstract = {The distance-redshift relation plays a fundamental role in constraining cosmological models. In this paper, we show that measurements of positions and time delays of strongly lensed images of a background galaxy, as well as those of the velocity dispersion and mass profile of a lens galaxy, can be combined to extract the angular diameter distance of the lens galaxy. Physically, as the velocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential ({GM}/r) and a mass ({GM}) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physical size (r) of the lens. Comparing the physical size with the image positions of a lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. A mismatch between the exact locations at which these measurements are made can be corrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. We expand on the original idea put forward by Paraficz and Hjorth, who analyzed singular
isothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law spherical mass density profile, an external convergence, and an
anisotropic velocity dispersion. We find that the effect of external convergence cancels out when dividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements. We derive a formula for the uncertainty in the angular diameter distance in terms of the uncertainties in the
observables. As an application, we use two existing strong lens systems, B1608+656 ({zL}=0.6304) and {RXJ}1131-1231
({zL}=0.295), to show that the uncertainty in the inferred angular diameter distances is dominated by that in the velocity
dispersion, σ2, and its anisotropy. We find that the
current data on these systems should yield about 16\% uncertainty in {DA} per object. This improves to 13\% when we measure
σ2 at the so-called sweet-spot radius. Achieving 7\% is possible if we can determine σ2 with 5\% precision.},

We provide a detailed systematic uncertainty budget, which has nearly
equal contributions from photometric calibration, astrophysical bias
corrections, and instrumental bias corrections. We also include several
new sources of systematic uncertainty. While our sample is less than
one-third the size of the Pantheon sample, our constraints on w are only
larger by 1.4×, showing the impact of the {DES}-{SN} Ia light-curve
quality. We find that the traditional stretch and color standardization
parameters of the {DES}-{SNe} Ia are in agreement with earlier {SN} Ia samples

photometrically identified (photometric) {SN} samples. Here we re-analyse
the {SDSS} photometric {SN} sample, with roughly 700 high-quality, likely
but unconfirmed {SNIa} light-curves, to develop new analysis tools aimed
at evaluating systematic uncertainties on the dark energy
equation-of-state parameter \$w\$. Since we require a spectroscopically
measured host galaxy redshift for each {SN}, we determine the associated
selection efficiency of host galaxies in order to simulate bias
corrections. We determine that the mis-association rate of host galaxies
is \$0.6{\textbackslash}\%\$; ignoring this effect in simulated bias corrections leads to
a \$w\$-bias of \${\textbackslash}Delta w = +0.0007\$, where \$w\$ is evaluated from {SNIa} and
priors from measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations and the cosmic
microwave background. We assess the uncertainty in our modeling of the
host galaxy selection efficiency and find the associated \$w\$ uncertainty

simulated training samples and find that adjusting the {CC} luminosity

summary information (e.g. detection efficiency versus signal-to-noise

	abstract = {The Wide-Field {InfraRed} Survey Telescope ({WFIRST}) mission is expected to 
launch in the mid-2020s. Its weak lensing program is designed to enable
unprecedented systematics control in photometric measurements, including
shear recovery, point-spread function ({PSF}) correction, and photometric
calibration. This will enable exquisite weak lensing science and allow
us to adjust to and reliably contribute to the cosmological landscape
after the initial years of observations from other concurrent Stage {IV}
dark energy experiments. This potential requires equally careful
planning and requirements validation as the mission prepares to enter
its construction phase. We present a suite of image simulations based on
{GalSim} that are used to construct a complex, synthetic {WFIRST} weak
lensing survey that incorporates realistic input galaxies and stars,
relevant detector non-idealities, and the current reference five-year
{WFIRST} survey strategy. We present a first study to empirically validate
the existing {WFIRST} weak lensing requirements flowdown using a suite of
12 matched image simulations, each representing a different perturbation
to the wavefront or image motion model. These are chosen to induce a
range of potential static and low- and high-frequency time-dependent {PSF}
model errors. We analyze the measured shapes of galaxies from each of
these simulations and compare them to a reference, fiducial simulation
to infer the response of the shape measurement to each of these modes in
the wavefront model. We then compare this to existing analytic flowdown
requirements, and find general agreement between the empirically derived
response and that predicted by the analytic model.},

Several {SN} models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved
light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with
arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about {SNe}.

	abstract = {Supernova ({SN}) rates are potentially powerful diagnostics of metal enrichment and {SN} physics, particularly in galaxy clusters with their deep, metal-retaining potentials and relatively simple star formation histories. We have carried out a survey for {SNe} in galaxy clusters, at a redshift range of 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9, using the Advanced Camera for
Surveys ({ACS}) on the Hubble Space Telescope. We reimaged a sample of 15 clusters that were previously imaged by {ACS}, thus obtaining two to three epochs per cluster in which we discovered five likely cluster {SNe}, six possible cluster Type Ia supernovae, two hostless {SN} candidates, and several background and foreground events. Keck spectra of the host galaxies were obtained to establish cluster membership. We conducted detailed efficiency simulations, and measured the stellar luminosities of the clusters using Subaru images. We derive a cluster {SN} rate of 0.35SNu B +0.17 -0.12(statistical) ±0.13(classification) ±0.01(systematic) (where {SNu} B
 = {SNe} (100 yr 1010 L B,sun)-1) and 0.112SNu M +0.055
-0.039(statistical) ±0.042(classification)
±0.005(systematic) (where {SNu} M = {SNe} (100 yr
1010 M sun)-1). As in previous
measurements of cluster {SN} rates, the uncertainties are dominated by small-number statistics. The {SN} rate in this redshift bin is consistent with the {SN} rate in clusters at lower redshifts (to within the
uncertainties), and shows that there is, at most, only a slight increase of cluster {SN} rate with increasing redshift. The low and fairly constant {SN} Ia rate out to z ≈ 1 implies that the bulk of the iron mass in clusters was already in place by z ≈ 1. The recently observed
doubling of iron abundances in the intracluster medium between z = 1 and 0, if real, is likely to be the result of redistribution of existing iron, rather than new production of iron.

Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and
reionization of the Universe from the cosmic “dark ages” to
the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ˜1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

Using empirical evidence and time-dependent, spherical models which treat H and He in non-{LTE}, we show that blackbody corrections caused by flux dilution are small for Type {II} supernovae in the infrared, and in the optical when their color temperatures are less than 6000 K. The extinction to a Type {II}-P supernova can be estimated from its light curve: the uncertainty introduced into a distance measurement due to extinction is usually less than 10\%. Correcting for extinction and flux dilution, we derive distances to 10 supernovae: {SN} 1968L, {SN} 1969L, {SN} 1970G, {SN} 1973R, {SN} 1979C, {SN} 1980K, {SN} 1987A, {SN} 1988A, {SN} 1990E, and {SN} 1990ae. The distance measurements span a wide range, 50 kpc to 120 Mpc which is unique among the methods for establishing the extragalactic distance scale. The distances measured to {SN} 1970G in M 101 and {SN} 1987A in the {LMC} are in good agreement with distances determined from Cepheid variable stars. Our distance to the Virgo Cluster, 22 +/- 3 Mpc, is larger than recent distance estimates made using surface brightness fluctuations, planetary nebula luminosity functions, and the Tully-Fisher method. Using the distances determined from these Type {II} supernovae, we derive a value of H\_0\_ = 60+/-10 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum} Mpc{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. This value is subject to errors caused by local deviations in the Hubble flow but will soon be improved by applying the Expanding Photosphere Method to several distant Type {II} supernovae.},

	abstract = {Supernovae ({SNe}) could be powerful probes of the properties of stars and galaxies at high redshifts in future surveys. Wide fields and longer exposure times are required to offset diminishing star formation rates and lower fluxes to detect useful numbers of events at high redshift. In principle, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) could discover large numbers of early {SNe} because of its wide fields but only at lower redshifts because of its {AB} mag limit of {\textasciitilde} 24. But gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters and massive galaxies could boost flux from ancient {SNe} and allow {LSST} to detect them at earlier times. Here, we calculate detection rates for lensed {SNe} at z {\textasciitilde} 5 - 7 for {LSST}. We find that the {LSST} Wide Deep Fast survey could detect up to 120 lensed Population (Pop) I and {II} {SNe} but no lensed Pop {III} {SNe}. Deep-drilling programs in a single 10 square degree {FoV} could detect Pop I and {II} core-collapse {SNe} and Pop {III} pair-instability {SNe} at {AB} magnitudes of 27 - 28 and 26, respectively. An alternative deep survey over 80 nights with a one-year cadence could find {\textasciitilde} 8 Pop {III} {SNe}.},

	abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

This phenomenon facilitates observations of high-redshift supernovae ({SNe}) that would otherwise remain undetected.

Our survey was based on 15 epochs of J-band observations with the {HAWK}-I instrument on the Very Large Telescope ({VLT}). We use Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) photometry to infer the global properties of the multiply-imaged galaxies. Using a recently published lensing model of Abell 370, we also present the predicted magnifications and time delays between the images. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Results: In our survey, we did not discover any live {SNe} from the 13 lensed galaxies with 47 multiple images behind Abell 370. This is consistent with the expectation of 0.09 ± 0.02 {SNe} calculated based on the measured star formation rate. We compare the expectations of discovering strongly lensed {SNe} in our survey and that performed with {HST} during the Hubble Frontier Fields ({HFF}) programme. We also show the expectations of search campaigns that can be conducted with future facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope ({JWST}) or the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope ({WFIRST}). We show that the {NIRCam} instrument aboard the {JWST} will be sensitive to most {SN} multiple images in the strongly lensed galaxies and thus will be able to measure their time delays if observations are scheduled accordingly.

This line-up allows for detailed studies of {SNe} at high redshift that otherwise would not be possible. Spectroscopic observations of lensed high-redshift Type Ia supernovae ({SNe} Ia) are of particular interest since they can be used to test for evolution of their intrinsic properties. The use of {SNe} Ia for probing the cosmic expansion history has proven to be an extremely powerful method for measuring cosmological parameters.

The magnitude-redshift data for these supernovae, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fitted jointly with a set of supernovae from the Calán/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters.

An open, Λ=0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is nonzero and positive, with a confidence of P(Λ\&gt;0)=99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties.

These objects, {SN} {CLO}12Car (z = 1.28), {SN} {CLN}12Did (z = 0.85), and {SN} {CLA}11Tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters, {MACSJ}1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), {RXJ}1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and A383 (z = 0.187), respectively.

Using multi-color light-curve fits to determine a standardized {SN} Ia luminosity distance, we infer that {SN} {CLO}12Car was {\textasciitilde}1.0 ± 0.2 mag brighter than field {SNe} Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens magnification. Similarly, {SN} {CLN}12Did is {\textasciitilde}0.2 ± 0.2 mag brighter than field {SNe} Ia.

The two {SNe} Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the {SN} Ia brightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent.

We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magnification bias and image configuration detectability into account. We find that upcoming wide-field synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) should find more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The {LSST} should also find some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with {\textasciitilde}15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be {\textasciitilde}15 per cent for the lensed quasars and {\textasciitilde}30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed double-image lenses, as could be derived from the {LSST} survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent confidence intervals are σ(w{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}) = 0.15, σ(w{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}a{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}) = 0.41 and σ(h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.},

	abstract = {We present a strong lens analysis of {SDSS} J1004+4112, a unique quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.68, using newly developed software for gravitational lensing. We find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations, including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magnification of μ ̃ 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.},

	abstract = {Time delays between lensed multiple images have been known to provide an interesting probe of the Hubble constant, but such an application is often limited by degeneracies with the shape of lens potentials. We propose a new statistical approach to examine the dependence of time delays on the complexity of lens potentials, such as higher order perturbations, nonisothermality, and substructures. Specifically, we introduce a dimensionless reduced time delay and explore its behavior analytically and numerically as a function of the image configuration, which is characterized by the asymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. In particular, we derive a realistic conditional probability distribution for a given image configuration from Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the probability distribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more symmetric and/or smaller opening-angle image pairs are more easily affected by perturbations on the primary lens potential. On average time delays of double lenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses. Furthermore, the realistic conditional distribution allows a new statistical method to constrain the Hubble constant from observed time delays. We find that 16 published time delay quasars constrain H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to be 70+/-6 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, where the value and its error are estimated using jackknife resampling. Systematic errors coming from the heterogeneous nature of the quasar sample and the uncertainty of the input distribution of lens potentials can be larger than the statistical error. After including rough estimates of important systematic errors, we find H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=68+/-6(stat.)+/-8(syst.) km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. The reasonable agreement of the value of the Hubble constant with other estimates indicates the usefulness of our new approach as a cosmological and astrophysical probe, particularly in the era of large-scale synoptic surveys.},

Such calibrations will be crucial when next-generation Hubble Space Telescope cluster surveys (e.g. Frontier) provide magnification maps that will, in turn, form the basis for the exploration of the high-redshift Universe. We classify {SNe} using combined photometric and spectroscopic observations, finding two of the three to be clearly of Type Ia and the third probable. The {SNe} exhibit significant amplification, up to a factor of 1.7 at ̃5σ significance ({SN}-L2). We conducted this as a blind study to avoid fine-tuning of parameters, finding a mean amplification difference between {SNe} and the cluster lensing models of 0.09 ± 0.09{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}stat{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} ± 0.05{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}sys{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} mag.

However, the measured statistical dispersion of σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.21 mag appeared large compared to the dispersion expected based on statistical uncertainties (0.14). Further work with the {SN} and cluster lensing models, post-unblinding, reduced the measured dispersion to σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.12. An explicit choice should thus be made as to whether {SNe} are used unblinded to improve the model, or blinded to test the model. As the lensed {SN} samples grow larger, this technique will allow improved constraints on assumptions regarding e.g. the structure of the dark matter halo.},

In a hypothetical 1 yr survey, it should be possible to detect up to several thousand {SNe} per unit redshift at z{\textasciitilde}6. We discuss the possible application of such a large sample of distant {SNe} as a probe of the epoch of reionization. By heating the intergalactic medium ({IGM}) and raising the cosmological Jeans mass, the process of reionization can suppress star formation in low-mass galaxies. This could have produced a relatively sharp drop in the {SN} rate around the redshift of reionization (z{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}re{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}). We quantify the detectability of this feature in future surveys of distant {SNe} by varying the redshift and duration of reionization, as well as its impact on the {SFR} in low-mass halos, which results in different redshifts, widths, and sizes of the drop in the expected {SFR}. We find that the drop can be detected out to z{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}re{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}13, as long as (1) the reionization history contains a relatively rapid feature that is synchronized over different regions to within ∆z\&lt;{\textasciitilde}1-3, (2) the star formation efficiency in halos that dominate reionization is ∊{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}*{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10\%, and (3) reionization significantly suppresses the star formation in low-mass halos.

As the supernova is of Type Ia where the intrinsic luminosity is usually well known, accurately measured time delays of the multiple images could provide tight constraints on the Hubble constant. According to our lens mass models constrained by the Hubble Space Telescope F814W image, we expect the maximum relative time delay to be less than a day, which is consistent with the maximum of 100 hr reported by Goobar et al. but places a stringent upper limit. Furthermore, the fluxes of most of the supernova images depart from expected values suggesting that they are affected by microlensing. The microlensing timescales are small enough that they may pose significant problems to measure the time delays reliably. Our lensing rate calculation indicates that the occurrence of a lensed {SN} in {iPTF} is likely. However, the observed total magnification of {iPTF}16geu is larger than expected, given its redshift. This may be a further indication of ongoing microlensing in this system.},

	abstract = {Lens time delays are a powerful probe of cosmology, provided that the gravitational potential of the main deflector can be modeled with sufficient precision. Recent work has shown that this can be achieved by detailed modeling of the host galaxies of lensed quasars, which appear as ``Einstein Rings'' in high resolution images. The distortion of these arcs and counter-arcs, as measured over a large number of pixels, provides tight constraints on the difference between the gravitational potential between the quasar image positions, and thus on cosmology in combination with the measured time delay. We carry out a systematic exploration of the high resolution imaging required to exploit the thousands of lensed quasars that will be discovered by current and upcoming surveys with the next decade. Specifically, we simulate realistic lens systems as imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}), James Webb Space Telescope ({JWST}), and ground based adaptive optics images taken with Keck or the Thirty Meter Telescope ({TMT}). We compare the performance of these pointed observations with that of images taken by the Euclid ({VIS}), Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope ({WFIRST}) and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) surveys. We use as our metric the precision with which the slope γ' of the total mass density profile ρ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}tot{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}propto r{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-γ'{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} for the main deflector can be measured. Ideally, we require that the statistical error on γ' be less than 0.02, such that it is subdominant to other sources of random and systematic uncertainties. We find that survey data will likely have sufficient depth and resolution to meet the target only for the brighter gravitational lens systems, comparable to those discovered by the {SDSS} survey. For fainter systems, that will be discovered by current and future surveys, targeted follow-up will be required. However, the exposure time required with upcoming facilitites such as {JWST}, the Keck Next Generation Adaptive Optics System, and {TMT}, will only be of order a few minutes per system, thus making the follow-up of hundreds of systems a practical and efficient cosmological probe.},

We simulate lens fields with realistic three-dimensional mass configurations (self-consistently including voids), and then fit mock lensing observables with increasingly complex lens models to quantify biases and uncertainties associated with different ways of treating the lens environment ({ENV}) and {LOS}. We identify the combination of mass, projected offset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for lensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential than background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and downweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net strength of {ENV}/{LOS} effects across different lens fields; modeling fields individually yields stronger priors for H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} than ray tracing through N-body simulations. Models that ignore mass outside the lens yield poor fits and biased results. Adding external shear can account for tidal stretching from galaxies at redshifts z≥slant \{z\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{lens{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\}, but it requires corrections for external convergence and cannot reproduce nonlinear effects from foreground galaxies. Using the tidal approximation is reasonable for most perturbers as long as nonlinear redshift effects are included. Even then, the scatter in H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} is limited by the lens profile degeneracy. Asymmetric image configurations produced by highly elliptical lens galaxies are less sensitive to the lens profile degeneracy, so they offer appealing targets for precision lensing analyses in future surveys like {LSST} and Euclid.},

The Frontier Fields combines the power of {HST} and Spitzer with the natural gravitational telescopes of massive high-magnification clusters of galaxies to produce the deepest observations of clusters and their lensed galaxies ever obtained. Six clusters—Abell 2744, {MACSJ}0416.1-2403, {MACSJ}0717.5+3745, {MACSJ}1149.5+2223, Abell S1063, and Abell 370—have been targeted by the {HST} {ACS}/{WFC} and {WFC}3/{IR} cameras with coordinated parallel fields for over 840 {HST} orbits.

Galaxies behind the clusters experience typical magnification factors of a few, with small regions magnified by factors of 10-100.

The observational properties of the light curves cover the range in quality obtained for current targeted efforts (e.g., {COSMOGRAIL}) and expected from future synoptic surveys (e.g., {LSST}), and include simulated systematic errors. Seven teams participated in {TDC}1, submitting results from 78 different method variants. After describing each method, we compute and analyze basic statistics measuring accuracy (or bias) A, goodness of fit χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, precision P, and success rate f. For some methods we identify outliers as an important issue. Other methods show that outliers can be controlled via visual inspection or conservative quality control.

The fraction of light curves yielding a time delay measurement is typically in the range f = 20\%-40\%. It depends strongly on the quality of the data: {COSMOGRAIL}-quality cadence and light curve lengths yield significantly higher f than does sparser sampling.

Gravitational magnification of a background {SN} Ia by an intervening cluster would cause a mismatch between the observed {SN} Ia peak magnitude compared with that expected from its {LCS} and redshift.

Microlensing events caused by {MACHOs} of smaller mass can unambiguously be identified in the {SN} light curve if the latter is continuously monitored.

	abstract = {With the advent of large, deep surveys, the observation of a strongly gravitationally lensed supernova becomes increasingly likely. High-redshift surveys continue apace, with a handful of Type Ia supernovae observed to date at redshifts of 1 or greater. In addition, a satellite has been proposed (the Supernova/Acceleration Probe [{SNAP}]) that will be dedicated to observing thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply imaged supernova from ongoing surveys, we find that {SNAP} would observe at least eight such events per year. Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, {SNAP}'s large sample of Type {II} supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image separations, and relative image magnifications, and the {SNAP} strong-lensing database will offer measures of Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, and H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, independent of {SNAP}'s primary goal of establishing the distance-redshift relation. These systems also constrain models for the matter density profiles of galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, lensed Type Ia supernovae afford us the opportunity to break the mass-sheet degeneracy found in many lensing measurements.},

In particular, we show that the power spectrum of projected density fluctuations in galaxy halos can be measured using strong gravitational lensing. We develop the mathematical framework of power spectrum estimation, and test our method on mock observations. We use our results to determine the types of observations required to measure the substructure power spectrum with high significance. We predict that deep observations ({\textasciitilde}10 hours on a single target) with current facilities can measure this power spectrum at the 3σ level, with no apparent degeneracy with unknown clumpiness in the background source structure or fluctuations from detector noise.

Taking advantage of the lensing information associated to the presence of very close pairs of multiple images at various redshifts, and to the extended surface brightness distribution of the {SN} Refsdal host, we can reconstruct the total mass-density profile of the cluster very precisely. The combined dependence of the multiple-image positions and time delays on the cosmological parameters allows us to infer the values of H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} with relative (1σ) statistical errors of, respectively, 6\% (7\%) and 31\% (26\%) in flat (general) cosmological models, assuming a conservative 3\% uncertainty on the final time delay of image {SX} and, remarkably, no priors from other cosmological experiments. Our best estimate of H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, based on the model described in this work, will be presented when the final time-delay measurement becomes available.

Starting from the combination of our catalog with those obtained from extensive spectroscopic and photometric campaigns using the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}), we select a sample of 300 (164 spectroscopic and 136 photometric) cluster members, within approximately 500 kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy, and a set of 88 reliable multiple images associated with 10 different background source galaxies and 18 distinct knots in the spiral galaxy hosting {SN} “Refsdal.” We exploit this valuable information to build six detailed strong-lensing models, the best of which reproduces the observed positions of the multiple images with an rms offset of only 0.″26. We use these models to quantify the statistical and systematic errors on the predicted values of magnification and time delay of the next emerging image of {SN} “Refsdal.” We find that its peak luminosity should occur between 2016 March and June and should be approximately 20\% fainter than the dimmest (S4) of the previously detected images but above the detection limit of the planned {HST}/{WFC}3 follow-up.

This uncertainty has comparable effects on cosmological parameters to that arising from the mass model of the deflector and its immediate environment. Photometric redshifts based on g, r, i and K photometries are sufficient to constrain κ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} almost as well as with spectroscopic redshifts. As an illustration, we apply our method to the system B1608+656. Our most reliable κ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} estimator gives σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}κ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.047 down from 0.065 using only galaxy counts. Although deeper multiband observations of the field of B1608+656 are necessary to obtain a more precise estimate, we conclude that {griK} photometry, in addition to spectroscopy to characterize the immediate environment, is an effective way to increase the precision of time-delay cosmography.},

This phenomenon was identified because the light from the stellar explosion was magnified more than 50 times by the curvature of space around matter in an intervening galaxy. We used high-spatial-resolution observations to resolve four images of the lensed supernova, approximately 0.3 arc seconds from the center of the foreground galaxy. The observations probe a physical scale of {\textasciitilde}1 kiloparsec, smaller than is typical in other studies of extragalactic gravitational lensing. The large magnification and symmetric image configuration imply close alignment between the lines of sight to the supernova and to the lens. The relative magnifications of the four images provide evidence for substructures in the lensing galaxy.},

	abstract = {Time delays between the multiple images of strongly gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae ({glSNe} Ia) have the potential to deliver precise cosmological constraints, but the effects of microlensing on time delay extraction have not been studied in detail. Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the {glSN} Ia yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) and the effect of microlensing on the precision and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from {LSST} {glSNe} Ia. Microlensing has a negligible effect on the {LSST} {glSN} Ia yield, but it can be increased by a factor of ̃2 over previous predictions to 930 systems using a novel photometric identification technique based on spectral template fitting. Crucially, the microlensing of {glSNe} Ia is achromatic until three rest-frame weeks after the explosion, making the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay indicators. By fitting simulated flux and color observations of microlensed {glSNe} Ia with their underlying, unlensed spectral templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for {LSST}, which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color curve observations in the achromatic phase, while for light-curve observations it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties (4\%). About 70\% of {LSST} {glSN} Ia images should be discovered during the achromatic phase, indicating that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for microlensing, the 1-2 day time delay on the recently discovered {glSN} Ia {iPTF}16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.},

	abstract = {Type Ia supernovae ({SNe} Ia) that are multiply imaged by gravitational lensing can extend the {SN} Ia Hubble diagram to very high redshifts (z ≳ 2), probe potential {SN} Ia evolution, and deliver high-precision constraints on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, w, and Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} via time delays. However, only one, {iPTF}16geu, has been found to date, and many more are needed to achieve these goals. To increase the multiply imaged {SN} Ia discovery rate, we present a simple algorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed {SN} Ia candidates in cadenced, wide-field optical imaging surveys. The technique is to look for supernovae that appear to be hosted by elliptical galaxies, but that have absolute magnitudes implied by the apparent hosts’ photometric redshifts that are far brighter than the absolute magnitudes of normal {SNe} Ia (the brightest type of supernovae found in elliptical galaxies). Importantly, this purely photometric method does not require the ability to resolve the lensed images for discovery. Active galactic nuclei, the primary sources of contamination that affect the method, can be controlled using catalog cross-matches and color cuts. Highly magnified core-collapse {SNe} will also be discovered as a byproduct of the method. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we forecast that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope can discover up to 500 multiply imaged {SNe} Ia using this technique in a 10 year z-band search, more than an order of magnitude improvement over previous estimates. We also predict that the Zwicky Transient Facility should find up to 10 multiply imaged {SNe} Ia using this technique in a 3 year R-band search—despite the fact that this survey will not resolve a single system.},

The {SN} Ia rate in galaxy clusters as a function of cluster redshift is an almost-direct measure of the {DTD}, but current estimates have been limited out to a mean redshift \&lt;z\&gt; = 1.1, corresponding to time delays, after cluster star formation, of ≳3.2 Gyr. We analyze data from a Hubble Space Telescope monitoring project of 12 galaxy clusters at z = 1.13-1.75, where we discover 29 {SNe}, and present their multiband light curves. Based on the {SN} photometry and the apparent host galaxies, we assess cluster membership and {SN} type, finding 11cases that are likely {SNe} Ia in cluster galaxies and 4 more cases, which are possible but not certain cluster {SNe} Ia. We conduct simulations to estimate the {SN} detection efficiency, the experiment's completeness, and the photometric errors, and perform photometry of the cluster galaxies to derive the cluster stellar masses. With this input, we obtain a mean \&lt;z\&gt; = 1.35 cluster rest-frame {SN} Ia rate per unit formed stellar mass of R\_\{Ia, m*\}=2.6{\textasciicircum}\{+ 3.2\} \_\{- 1.5\} × 10{\textasciicircum}\{-13\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} M\_☉ {\textasciicircum}\{-1\}.

We confirm previous indications for a {SN} Ia production efficiency that is several times higher in galaxy clusters than in the field, perhaps caused by a peculiar stellar initial mass function in clusters, or by a higher incidence of binaries that will evolve into {SNe} Ia.},

We present predictions for the amount of scatter induced by microlensing across a range of plausible strong lens macromodels. We find that lensed images in regions of low convergence, shear and stellar density are standardizable, where the microlensing scatter is ≲ 0.15 mag, comparable to the intrinsic dispersion of a typical {SN} Ia. These standardizable configurations correspond to asymmetric lenses with an image located far outside the Einstein radius of the lens. Symmetric and small Einstein radius lenses (≲ 0.5 arcsec) are not standardizable. We apply our model to the recently discovered {GLSN} Ia {iPTF}16geu and find that the large discrepancy between the observed flux and the macromodel predictions from More et al. cannot be explained by microlensing alone. Using the mock {GLSNe} Ia catalogue of Goldstein et al., we predict that ̃22 per cent of {GLSNe} Ia discovered by Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) will be standardizable, with a median Einstein radius of 0.9 arcsec and a median time delay of 41 d.

The 64 epochs of observation have an average spacing of 3.6 days. The light curves of the four images of the background source show that the flux density of the background source has varied at the {\textasciitilde}5\% level. We measure time delays in the system based on common features that are seen in all four light curves. The three independent time delays in the system are found to be ∆t{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{BA}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=31+/-7 days, ∆t{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{BC}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=36+/-7 days, and ∆t{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{BD}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=76{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+9{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-10{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} days at 95\% confidence. The uncertainties on the time delays are determined by Monte Carlo simulations that use fake light curves that have the characteristics of the observed light curves. This is the first gravitational lens system for which three independent time delays have been measured. A companion paper presents a mass model for the lensing galaxy that correctly reproduces the observed image positions, flux density ratios, and time delay ratios. The last condition is crucial for determining H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} with a four-image lens.

A fraction of these primordial stars are expected to die as pair-instability supernovae ({PISNe}), and should be bright enough to be observed up to a few hundred million years after the big bang. While the quest for Population {III} stars continues, detailed theoretical models and computer simulations serve as a testbed for their observability. With the upcoming near-infrared missions, estimates of the feasibility of detecting {PISNe} are not only timely but imperative.

This data qualityallows us to catch small photometric variations (a few mmag rms) of the quasar, acting on temporal scales much shorter than microlensing, and hence making the time delay measurement very robust against microlensing. In only seven months we very accurately measured one of the time delays in {DES} J0408-5354: ∆t({AB}) = -112.1 ± 2.1 days (1.8\%) using only the {MPIA} 2.2 m data.

	abstract = {The gravitational lens {CLASS} B1608+656 is the only four-image lens system for which all three independent time delays have been measured. This makes the system an excellent candidate for a high-quality determination of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} at cosmological distances. However, the original measurements of the time delays had large (12\%-20\%) uncertainties, due to the low level of variability of the background source during the monitoring campaign. In this paper, we present results from two additional {VLA} monitoring campaigns. In contrast to the {\textasciitilde}5\% variations seen during the first season of monitoring, the source flux density changed by 25\%-30\% in each of the subsequent two seasons. We analyzed the combined data set from all three seasons of monitoring to improve significantly the precision of the time delay measurements; the delays are consistent with those found in the original measurements, but the uncertainties have decreased by factors of 2-3. We combined the delays with revised isothermal mass models to derive a measurement of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. Depending on the positions of the galaxy centroids, which vary by up to 0.1" in Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) images obtained with different filters, we obtain H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=61-65 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, for (Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}M{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater},Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater})=(0.3,0.7). The value of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} decreases by 6\% if (Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}M{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater},Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater})=(1.0,0.0). The formal uncertainties on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} due to the time-delay measurements are +/-1 (+/-2) km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} for the 1 σ (2 σ) confidence limits. Thus, the systematic uncertainties due to the lens model, which are on the order of +/-15 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, now dominate the error budget for this system.

	abstract = {The images of a background source formed by a foreground mass distribution in a matter-dominated Friedmann cosmology are considered. A transformation is presented that leaves unchanged the image observables, including positions, relative magnifications, apparent luminosities, and differences in propagation times associated with image pairs. The observables are related to the parameters of the source and of a generalized lens model. The transformation is applied to these relations to scale the value of H(0) and to modify the mass distribution of the lens and move the position of the source. One lens model for Q0957 + 561 is discussed in the context of this transformation. The elliptical galaxy G1 is modelled as a singular isothermal sphere, and the light bending of the cluster is represented as a linear function of the impact parameter. It is shown that this model accounts for the positions and relative magnifications of images of Q0957 + 561 and yields a bound on H(0).},

It is within one of these images that the first example of a multiply lensed supernova ({SN}) has been detected recently as part of the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space. The depth of this data also reveals many H {II} regions within the lensed spiral galaxy which we identify between the five counter-images. Here, we expand the capability of our free-form method to incorporate these H {II} regions locally, with other reliable lensed galaxies added for a global solution. This improved accuracy allows us to estimate when the Refsdal {SN} will appear within the other lensed images of the spiral galaxy to an accuracy of ̃7 per cent. We predict this {SN} will reappear in one of the counter-images ({RA} = 11:49:36.025, Dec. = +22:23:48.11, J2000) and on 2015 November 1 (with an estimated error of ±25 d) it will be at the same phase as it was when it was originally discovered, offering a unique opportunity to study the early phases of this {SN} and to examine the consistency of the mass model and the cosmological model that have an impact on the time delay prediction.},

We spacially deconvolved {HST} {NICMOS}2 F160W images to derive accurate astrometry of the quasar images and to infer the light profile of the lensing galaxy. We combined these images with a stellar population fitting of a deep {VLT} spectrum of the lensing galaxy to estimate the baryonic fraction, f{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, in the Einstein radius. We measured f{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.65{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.10{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.13{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} if the lensing galaxy has a Salpeter {IMF} and f{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.45{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.07{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.04{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} if it has a Kroupa {IMF}.

Given the current error bars on f{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ap{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, we did not constrain H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} yet with high accuracy, i.e., we found a broad range of models with χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} \&lt; 1.

	abstract = {Inferring cosmological parameters from time-delay strong lenses requires a significant investment of telescope time; it is therefore tempting to focus on the systems with the brightest sources, the highest image multiplicities and the widest image separations. We investigate if this selection bias can influence the properties of the lenses studied and the cosmological parameters inferred. Using an ellipsoidal power-law deflector population, we build a sample of double- and quadruple-image systems. Assuming reasonable thresholds on image separation and flux, based on current lens monitoring campaigns, we find that the typical density profile slopes of monitorable lenses are significantly shallower than the input ensemble. From a sample of quads, we find that this selection function can introduce a 3.5 per cent bias on the inferred time-delay distances if the properties of the input ensemble are (incorrectly) used as priors on the lens model. This bias remains at the 2.4 per cent level when high-resolution imaging of the quasar host is used to precisely infer the properties of individual lenses. We also investigate if the lines of sight for monitorable strong lenses are biased. The expectation value for the line-of-sight convergence is increased by 0.009 (0.004) for quads (doubles) implying a 0.9 per cent (0.4 per cent) bias on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. We therefore conclude that whilst the properties of typical quasar lenses and their lines of sight do deviate from the global population, the total magnitude of this effect is likely to be a subdominant effect for current analyses, but has the potential to be a major systematic for samples of ̃25 or more lenses.},

We compare these constraints (as well as those for a more general cosmology) to the "optimistic Stage {IV}" constraints expected from weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cluster counts, as calculated by the Dark Energy Task Force. {TDs} yield a modest constraint on a time-varying w(z), with the best constraint on w(z) at the "pivot redshift" of z ≈ 0.31. Our Fisher matrix calculation is provided to allow {TD} constraints to be easily compared to and combined with constraints from other experiments. We also show how cosmological constraining power varies as a function of numbers of lenses, lens model uncertainty, {TD} precision, redshift precision, and the ratio of four-image to two-image lenses.},

In this work, we aim to present the first attempt at modelling line-of-sight ({LOS}) mass distribution in addition to that of the cluster, extending previous modelling techniques that assume mass distributions to be on a single lens plane. We have focussed on the Hubble Frontier Field cluster {MACS} J0416.1-2403, and our multi-plane model reproduces the observed image positions with a rms offset of 0.''53. Starting from this best-fitting model, we simulated a mock cluster that resembles {MACS} J0416.1-2403 in order to explore the effects of {LOS} structures on cluster mass modelling. By systematically analysing the mock cluster under different model assumptions, we find that neglecting the lensing environment has a significant impact on the reconstruction of image positions (rms 0.''3); accounting for {LOS} galaxies as if they were at the cluster redshift can partially reduce this offset. Moreover, foreground galaxies are more important to include into the model than the background ones. While the magnification factor of the lensed multiple images are recovered within 10\% for 95\% of them, those 5\% that lie near critical curves can be significantly affected by the exclusion of the lensing environment in the models. In addition, {LOS} galaxies cannot explain the apparent discrepancy in the properties of massive sub-halos between {MACS} J0416.1-2403 and N-body simulated clusters. Since our model of {MACS} J0416.1-2403 with {LOS} galaxies only reduced modestly the rms offset in the image positions, we conclude that additional complexities would be needed in future models of {MACS} J0416.1-2403.},

With Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) imaging, each strong gravitational lens system with measured time delays can allow one to determine the Hubble constant with an uncertainty of ̃7 per cent. Since {HST} will not last forever, we explore adaptive-optics ({AO}) imaging as an alternative that can provide higher angular resolution than {HST} imaging but has a less stable point spread function ({PSF}) due to atmospheric distortion. To make {AO} imaging useful for time-delay-lens cosmography, we develop a method to extract the unknown {PSF} directly from the imaging of strongly lensed quasars. In a blind test with two mock data sets created with different {PSFs}, we are able to recover the important cosmological parameters (time-delay distance, external shear, lens-mass profile slope, and total Einstein radius). Our analysis of the Keck {AO} image of the strong lens system {RXJ} 1131-1231 shows that the important parameters for cosmography agree with those based on {HST} imaging and modelling within 1σ uncertainties. Most importantly, the constraint on the model time-delay distance by using {AO} imaging with 0.09 arcsec resolution is tighter by ̃50 per cent than the constraint of time-delay distance by using {HST} imaging with 0.09 arcsec when a power-law mass distribution for the lens system is adopted. Our {PSF} reconstruction technique is generic and applicable to data sets that have multiple nearby point sources, enabling scientific studies that require high-precision models of the {PSF}.},

The precision of the H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurement depends on the uncertainties in the time-delay measurements, the mass distribution of the main deflector(s), and the mass distribution along the line of sight. Tie \&amp; Kochanek have proposed a new microlensing effect on time delays based on differential magnification of the coherent accretion disc variability of the lensed quasar. If real, this effect could significantly broaden the uncertainty on the time-delay measurements by up to 30 per cent for lens systems such as {PG} 1115+080, which have relatively short time delays and monitoring over several different epochs. In this paper we develop a new technique that uses the cosmological time-delay ratios and simulated microlensing maps within a Bayesian framework in order to limit the allowed combinations of microlensing delays and thus to lessen the uncertainties due to the proposed effect. We show that, under the assumption of Tie \&amp; Kochanek, the uncertainty on the time-delay distance (D{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, which is proportional to 1/H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}) of the short time-delay (̃18 d) lens, {PG} 1115+080, increases from ̃7 per cent to ̃10 per cent by simultaneously fitting the three time-delay measurements from the three different data sets across 20 yr, while in the case of the long time-delay (̃90 d) lens, the microlensing effect on time delays is negligible as the uncertainty on D{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} of {RXJ} 1131-1231 only increases from ̃2.5 per cent to ̃2.6 per cent.},

	abstract = {The spectacular success of Type Ia supernovae ({SNe} Ia) in {SN}-cosmology is based on the assumption that their photometric and spectroscopic properties are invariant with redshift. However, this fundamental assumption needs to be tested with observations of high-z {SNe} Ia. To date, the majority of {SNe} Ia observed at moderate to large redshifts (0.4 ≤ z ≤ 1.0) are faint, and the resultant analyses are based on observations with modest signal-to-noise ratios that impart a degree of ambiguity in their determined properties. In rare cases, however, the Universe offers a helping hand: To date a few {SNe} Ia have been observed that have had their luminosities magnified by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters acting as gravitational lenses. In this paper, we present long-slit spectroscopy of the lensed {SN} Ia 2016geu, which occurred at a redshift of z = 0.409, and was magnified by a factor of ≈55 by a galaxy located at z = 0.216. We compared our spectra, which were obtained a couple of weeks to a couple of months past peak light, with the spectroscopic properties of well-observed, nearby {SNe} Ia, finding that {SN} 2016geu's properties are commensurate with those of {SNe} Ia in the local Universe. Based primarily on the velocity and strength of the Si {II} λ6355 absorption feature, we find that {SN} 2016geu can be classified as a high-velocity, high-velocity-gradient and 'core-normal' {SN} Ia. The strength of various features (measured though their pseudo-equivalent widths) argue against {SN} 2016geu being a faint, broad-lined, cool or shallow-silicon {SN} Ia. We conclude that the spectroscopic properties of {SN} 2016geu imply that it is a normal {SN} Ia, and when taking previous results by other authors into consideration, there is very little, if any, evolution in the observational properties of {SNe} Ia up to z ≈ 0.4.},

Our results are based on almost daily observations for seven months at the {ESO} {MPIA} 2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. In addition, we re-analyze existing light curves from the literature that we complete with an additional three seasons of monitoring with the Mercator telescope at La Palma Observatory. When exploring the possible source of bias we considered the so-called microlensing time delay, a potential source of systematic error so far never directly accounted for in previous time-delay publications. In 15 yr of data on {PG} 1115+080, we find no strong evidence of microlensing time delay. Therefore not accounting for this effect, our time-delay estimates on the individual data sets are in good agreement with each other and with the literature. Combining the data sets, we obtain the most precise time-delay estimates to date on {PG} 1115+080, with ∆t({AB}) = 8.3{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+1.5{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-1.6{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} days (18.7\% precision), ∆t({AC}) = 9.9{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+1.1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-1.1{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} days (11.1\%) and ∆t({BC}) = 18.8{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+1.6{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-1.6{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} days (8.5\%).

	abstract = {{COSMOGRAIL} is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed quasars aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological parameters, in particular H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. Given the long and well sampled light curves of strongly lensed quasars, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques whose quality must be assessed. To this end, and also in view of future monitoring programs or surveys such as the {LSST}, a blind signal processing competition named Time Delay Challenge 1 ({TDC}1) was held in 2014. The aim of the present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the {TDC}1, is double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement techniques currently used in {COSMOGRAIL}. Second, we analyse the quantity and quality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the {TDC}1 simulations. To achieve these goals, we first discover time delays through a careful inspection of the light curves via a dedicated visual interface.

	abstract = {We present extended modelling of the strong lens system {RXJ}1131-1231 with archival data in two {HST} bands in combination with existing line-of-sight contribution and velocity dispersion estimates. Our focus is on source size and its influence on time-delay cosmography. We therefore examine the impact of mass-sheet degeneracy and especially the degeneracy pointed out by Schneider \&amp; Sluse (2013) [1] using the source reconstruction scale. We also extend on previous work by further exploring the effects of priors on the kinematics of the lens and the external convergence in the environment of the lensing system. Our results coming from {RXJ}1131-1231 are given in a simple analytic form so that they can be easily combined with constraints coming from other cosmological probes. We find that the choice of priors on lens model parameters and source size are subdominant for the statistical errors for H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurements of this systems. The choice of prior for the source is sub-dominant at present (2\% uncertainty on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}) but may be relevant for future studies. More importantly, we find that the priors on the kinematic anisotropy of the lens galaxy have a significant impact on our cosmological inference. When incorporating all the above modeling uncertainties, we find H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 86.6{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+6.8{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-6.9{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, when using kinematic priors similar to other studies. When we use a different kinematic prior motivated by Barnabè et al. (2012) [2] but covering the same anisotropic range, we find H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 74.5{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+8.0{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-7.8{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. This means that the choice of kinematic modeling and priors have a significant impact on cosmographic inferences. The way forward is either to get better velocity dispersion measures which would down weight the impact of the priors or to construct physically motivated priors for the velocity dispersion model.},

This measurement is generally consistent with expectations for the "double degenerate" scenario and inconsistent with some models for the "single degenerate" scenario predicting a steeper {DTD} at large delay times. We check for environmental dependence and the influence of younger stellar populations by calculating the rate specifically in cluster red-sequence galaxies and in morphologically early-type galaxies, finding results similar to the full cluster rate. Finally, the upper limit of one hostless cluster {SN} Ia detected in the survey implies that the fraction of stars in the intra-cluster medium is less than 0.47 (95\% confidence), consistent with measurements at lower redshifts.

We identify promising color trends that may permit the identification of stripped-envelope {SN} subtypes from their photometry alone. Many of these {SNe} were observed spectroscopically by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics ({CfA}) {SN} group, and the spectra are presented in a companion paper.

We combine the relative time delay between the quasar images, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, the Keck stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, and wide-field photometric and spectroscopic data of the field to constrain two angular diameter distance relations. The combined analysis is performed by forward modelling the individual data sets through a Bayesian hierarchical framework, and it is kept blind until the very end to prevent experimenter bias. After unblinding, the inferred distances imply a Hubble constant H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 68.8{\textasciicircum}\{+5.4\}\_\{-5.1\} km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, assuming a flat Λ cold dark matter cosmology with uniform prior on Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} in [0.05, 0.5]. The precision of our cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar {SDSS} 1206+4332 is comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads. Our analysis is based on a completely independent lensing code than our previous three H0LiCOW systems and the new measurement is fully consistent with those. We provide the analysis scripts paired with the publicly available software to facilitate independent analysis (footnote with link to www.h0licow.org). The consistency between blind measurements with independent codes provides an important sanity check on lens modelling systematics.

Companion papers detail the modelling of the main deflectors and line-of-sight effects, and how these data are combined to determine the time-delay distance of {HE} 0435-1223. Crucially, the measurements are carried out blindly with respect to cosmological parameters in order to avoid confirmation bias.

If verified, this would provide both precise and accurate time-delay measurements, making lensed type-Ia supernovae a new golden standard for time-delay cosmography. However, the 3D geometry of the expanding shell can introduce an additional bias that has not yet been fully explored. In this work, we present and discuss the impact of this effect on time-delay cosmography with lensed supernovae and find that on average it leads to a bias of a few tenths of a day for individual lensed systems. This is negligible in view of the cosmological time delays predicted for typical lensed type-Ia supernovae but not for the specific case of the recently discovered type-Ia supernova {iPTF}16geu, whose time delays are expected to be smaller than a day.},

We have observed this target for more than six years, between March 2005 and July 2011, using the 1.2-m Mercator Telescope, the 1.5-m telescope of the Maidanak Observatory, and the 2-m Himalayan Chandra Telescope. Our resulting light curves are composed of 443 independent epochs, and show strong intrinsic quasar variability, with an amplitude of the order of 0.2 magnitudes. From this data, we measure the time delay using five different methods, all relying on distinct approaches. One of these techniques is a new development presented in this paper. All our time-delay measurements are perfectly compatible. By combining them, we conclude that image A is leading B by 119.3 ± 3.3 days (1σ, 2.8\% uncertainty), including systematic errors. It has been shown recently that such accurate time-delay measurements offer a highly complementary probe of dark energy and spatial curvature, as they independently constrain the Hubble constant. The next mandatory step towards using {SDSS} J1001+5027 in this context will be the measurement of the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, in combination with deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging.

If a massive object warps spacetime to form multiple images of a background {SNIa}, a direct test of cosmic expansion is also possible. However, these lensing events must first be distinguished from other rare phenomena. Recently, a supernova was found to shine much brighter than normal for its distance, which resulted in a debate: Was it a new type of superluminous supernova or a normal {SNIa} magnified by a hidden gravitational lens? Here, we report that a spectrum obtained after the supernova faded away shows the presence of a foreground galaxy—the first found to strongly magnify a {SNIa}. We discuss how more lensed {SNIa} can be found than previously predicted.},

The survey, described in detail in this paper, will definitively establish the degree of concentration of dark matter in the cluster cores, a key prediction of structure formation models. The {CLASH} cluster sample is larger and less biased than current samples of space-based imaging studies of clusters to similar depth, as we have minimized lensing-based selection that favors systems with overly dense cores. Specifically, 20 {CLASH} clusters are solely X-ray selected. The X-ray-selected clusters are massive ({kT} \&gt; 5 {keV}) and, in most cases, dynamically relaxed. Five additional clusters are included for their lensing strength (θ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Ein{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \&gt; 35'' at z{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 2) to optimize the likelihood of finding highly magnified high-z (z \&gt; 7) galaxies. A total of 16 broadband filters, spanning the near-{UV} to near-{IR}, are employed for each 20-orbit campaign on each cluster. These data are used to measure precise (σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater} z {\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 0.02(1 + z)) photometric redshifts for newly discovered arcs. Observations of each cluster are spread over eight epochs to enable a search for Type Ia supernovae at z \&gt; 1 to improve constraints on the time dependence of the dark energy equation of state and the evolution of supernovae.

The observations were obtained at ̃6 month intervals over 4 years. The distances are 1.7-3.6 kpc, with a mean precision of 45 μas (signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) ≈ 10) and a best precision of 29 μas (S/N = 14). The accuracy of the parallaxes is demonstrated through independent analyses of \&gt;100 reference stars. This raises to 10 the number of long-period Cepheids with significant parallax measurements, 8 obtained from this program. We also present high-precision mean F555W, F814W, and F160W magnitudes of these Cepheids, allowing a direct, zeropoint-independent comparison to \&gt;1800 extragalactic Cepheids in the hosts of 19 {SNe} Ia. This sample addresses two outstanding systematic uncertainties affecting prior comparisons of {MW} and extragalactic Cepheids used to calibrate the Hubble constant (H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}): their dissimilarity of periods and photometric systems. Comparing the new parallaxes to their predicted values derived from reversing the distance ladder gives a ratio (or independent scale for H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}) of 1.037 ± 0.036, consistent with no change and inconsistent at the 3.5σ level with a ratio of 0.91 needed to match the value predicted by Planck cosmic microwave background data in concert with Λ{CDM}. Using these data instead to augment the Riess et al. measurement of H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} improves the precision to 2.3\%, yielding 73.48 ± 1.66 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, and the tension with Planck + Λ{CDM} increases to 3.7σ.

We measure the under/overdensity of the line of sight towards the lens system and compare it to the average line of sight throughout the Universe, determined by using the {CFHTLenS} (The Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey) as a control field. Aiming to constrain κ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} as tightly as possible, we determine under/overdensities using various combinations of relevant informative weighting schemes for the galaxy counts, such as projected distance to the lens, redshift and stellar mass.

We explore several limiting magnitudes and apertures, and account for systematic and statistical uncertainties relevant to the quality of the observational data, which we further test through simulations.

	abstract = {The time-delay in gravitational lenses can be used to derive the Hubble constant in a relatively simple way. The results of this method are less dependent on astrophysical assumptions than in many other methods. For systems with accurately measured positions and time-delays, the most important uncertainty is related to the mass model used. Simple parametric models like isothermal ellipsoidal mass distributions seem to provide consistent results with a reasonably small scatter when applied to several lens systems. We discuss a family of models with a separable radial power law and an arbitrary angular dependence for the potential ψ=r{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}β{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}F(θ). Isothermal potentials are a special case of these models with β=1. An additional external shear is used to take into account perturbations from other galaxies. Using a simple linear formalism for quadruple lenses, we can derive H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} as a function of the observables and the shear. If the latter is fixed, the result depends on the assumed power-law exponent according to H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}(2-β)/β. The effect of external shear is quantified by introducing a `critical shear' γ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}c{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} as a measure for the amount of shear that changes the result significantly. The analysis shows that in the general case H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and γ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}c{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} do not depend on the position of the lens galaxy. Spherical lens models with images close to the Einstein radius with fitted external shear differ by a factor of β/2 from shearless models, leading to H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}2-β in this case. We discuss these results and compare them with numerical models for a number of real lens systems.},

	abstract = {A power-law density model, I.e. ρ (r) ∝ r{\textasciicircum}\{-γ {\textasciicircum}' \}\}, has been commonly employed in strong gravitational lensing studies, including the so-called time-delay technique used to infer the Hubble constant H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. However, since the radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonic matter to dark matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow a power law in density. The assumption of a power law artificially breaks the mass-sheet degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitational lensing which affects the product of Hubble constant and time delay and can therefore cause a bias in the determination of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} from the time-delay technique. In this paper, we use the Illustris hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related to observational properties of galaxies. Investigating a large sample of Illustris galaxies that have velocity dispersion σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{SIE}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} ≥ 160 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} at redshifts below z = 1, we find that the bias on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} introduced by the power-law assumption can reach 20-50 per cent, with a scatter of 10-30 per cent (rms). However, we find that by selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law model slope close to isothermal, it is possible to reduce the bias on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to ≲ 5 per cent and the scatter to ≲ 10 per cent. This could potentially be used to form less biased statistical samples for H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurements in the upcoming large survey era.},

	abstract = {Strongly lensed supernovae ({SNe}) can be detected as multiply imaged or highly magnified transients. In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of {SNe} (types Ia, {IIP}, {IIL}, Ibc, and {IIn}). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-{LSST} (Large Synoptic Sky Survey) surveys. For survey depths about the {LSST} capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed {SNe}. {SN} samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed {SNe} detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of {LSST}, detection rates of multiply imaged {SN} still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed {SNe} found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification. We provide useful fitting functions approximating the computed discovery rates for different {SN} classes and detection methods. We find that the Zwicky Transient Factory will find about two type Ia and four core-collapse lensed {SNe} per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that {LSST} will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed {SNe} per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed {SNe} will be dominated by type {IIn} {SNe} contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of {SNe}. Revisiting the case of the lensed {SN} {iPTF}16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2σ contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory survey.},

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lensing provides an independent measurement of the Hubble parameter (H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}). One remaining systematic is a bias from the additional mass due to a galaxy group at the lens redshift or along the sightline. We quantify this bias for more than 20 strong lenses that have well-sampled sightline mass distributions, focusing on the convergence κ and shear γ. In 23\% of these fields, a lens group contributes ≥1\% convergence bias; in 57\%, there is a similarly significant line-of-sight group. For the nine time-delay lens systems, H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} is overestimated by \{11\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+3{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}\% on average when groups are ignored. In 67\% of fields with total κ ≥slant 0.01, line-of-sight groups contribute ≳ 2× more convergence than do lens groups, indicating that the lens group is not the only important mass. Lens environment affects the ratio of four (quad) to two (double) image systems; all seven quads have lens groups while only 3 of 10 doubles do, and the highest convergences due to lens groups are in quads. We calibrate the γ-κ relation: \{log\}(\{κ \}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{tot{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\})=(1.94+/- 0.34)\{log\}(\{γ \}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{tot{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\}) +(1.31+/- 0.49) with an rms scatter of 0.34 dex. Although shear can be measured directly from lensed images, unlike convergence, it can be a poor predictor of convergence; for 19\% of our fields, κ is ≳ 2γ .

	abstract = {Multiple image gravitational lensing systems with measured time delays provide a promising one-step method for determining H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. {MACS} J1149, which lenses {SN} Refsdal into a quad S1-S4, and two other widely separated images, {SX} and {SY}, is a perfect candidate. If time delays are pinned down, the remaining uncertainty arises from the mass distribution in the lens. In {MACS} J1149, the mass in the relevant lens plane region can be constrained by (i) many multiple images, (ii) the mass of the galaxy splitting S1-S4 (which, we show, is correlated with H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}), (iii) magnification of {SX} (also correlated with H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}), and (iv) prior assumptions on the mass distribution. Our goal is not to estimate H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, but to understand its error budget, i.e. estimate uncertainties associated with each of these constraints. Using multiple image positions alone yields very large uncertainty, despite the fact that the position of {SX} is recovered to within ≤0.036 arcsec (rms ≤ 0.36 arcsec) by {GRALE} lens inversion. Fixing the mass of the galaxy that splits S1-S4 reduces 1σ uncertainties to \{̃ \} 23\{\{ per cent\}\}, while fixing the magnification of {SX} yields 1σ uncertainties of 32\{\{ per cent\}\}. We conclude that smaller uncertainties, of order few per cent, are a consequence of imposing prior assumptions on the shapes of the galaxy and cluster mass distributions, which may or may not apply in a highly non-equilibrium environment of a merging cluster. We propose that if a measurement of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} is to be considered reliable, it must be supported by a wide range of lens inversion methods.},

	abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein’s theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious efforts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations ({BAO}), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage {IV}” dark energy facilities such as {BigBOSS}, {LSST}, Euclid, and {WFIRST}. We briefly review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage {III} and Stage {IV} experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, {BAO}, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these fiducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientific investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

	shorttitle = {A First Transients Survey with {JWST}},
	abstract = {{JWST} was conceived and built to answer one of the most fundamental questions that humans can address empirically: "How did the Universe make its first stars?". Our First Lights At {REionization} ({FLARE}) project transforms the quest for the epoch of reionization from the static to the time domain. It targets the complementary question: "What happened to those first stars?". It will be answered by observations of the most luminous events: supernovae and accretion on to black holes formed by direct collapse from the primordial gas clouds. These transients provide direct constraints on star-formation rates ({SFRs}) and the truly initial Initial Mass Function ({IMF}), and they may identify possible stellar seeds of supermassive black holes ({SMBHs}). Furthermore, our knowledge of the physics of these events at ultra-low metallicity will be much expanded. {JWST}'s unique capabilities will detect these most luminous and earliest cosmic messengers easily in fairly shallow observations. However, these events are very rare at the dawn of cosmic structure formation and so require large area coverage. Time domain astronomy can be advanced to an unprecedented depth by means of a shallow field of {JWST} reaching 27 mag {AB} in 2 and 4.4 microns over a field as large as 0.1 square degree visited multiple times each year. Such a survey may set strong constraints or detect massive Pop {III} {SNe} at redshifts beyond 10, pinpointing the redshift of the first stars, or at least their death. Based on our current knowledge of superluminous supernovae ({SLSNe}), such a survey will find one or more {SLSNe} at redshifts above 6 in five years and possibly several direct collapse black holes. Although {JWST} is not designed as a wide field survey telescope, we show that such a wide field survey is possible with {JWST} and is critical in addressing several of its key scientific goals.},

The Wide Field Camera 3 ({WFC}3) yields near-infrared spectra of the cluster cores covering the wavelength range 0.81-1.69 μm through grisms G102 and G141, while the Advanced Camera for Surveys in parallel mode provides G800L spectra of the infall regions of the clusters.

After summarizing the scientific drivers of {GLASS}, we describe the sample selection as well as the observing strategy and data processing pipeline. We then utilize {MACS} J0717.5+3745, a {HFF} cluster and the first one observed by {GLASS}, to illustrate the data quality and the high-level data products. Each spectrum brighter than \{H\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{\{{AB}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\}\}=23 is visually inspected by at least two co-authors and a redshift is measured when sufficient information is present in the spectra.

	abstract = {Supernova “Refsdal,” multiply imaged by cluster {MACS}1149.5+2223, represents a rare opportunity to make a true blind test of model predictions in extragalactic astronomy, on a timescale that is short compared to a human lifetime. In order to take advantage of this event, we produced seven gravitational lens models with five independent methods, based on Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) Hubble Frontier Field images, along with extensive spectroscopic follow-up observations by {HST}, the Very Large and the Keck Telescopes. We compare the model predictions and show that they agree reasonably well with the measured time delays and magnification ratios between the known images, even though these quantities were not used as input. This agreement is encouraging, considering that the models only provide statistical uncertainties, and do not include additional sources of uncertainties such as structure along the line of sight, cosmology, and the mass sheet degeneracy. We then present the model predictions for the other appearances of supernova “Refsdal.” A future image will reach its peak in the first half of 2016, while another image appeared between 1994 and 2004. The past image would have been too faint to be detected in existing archival images. The future image should be approximately one-third as bright as the brightest known image (I.e., \{H\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{\{{AB}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\}\}≈ 25.7 mag at peak and \{H\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\{\{{AB}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\}\}≈ 26.7 mag six months before peak), and thus detectable in single-orbit {HST} images.

	abstract = {The time delays of gravitationally lensed quasars are generally believed to be unique numbers whose measurement is limited only by the quality of the light curves and the models for the contaminating contribution of gravitational microlensing to the light curves. This belief is incorrect - gravitational microlensing also produces changes in the actual time delays on the ̃day(s) light-crossing time-scale of the emission region. This is due to a combination of the inclination of the disc relative to the line of sight and the differential magnification of the temperature fluctuations producing the variability. We demonstrate this both mathematically and with direct calculations using microlensing magnification patterns. Measuring these delay fluctuations can provide a physical scale for microlensing observations, removing the need for priors on either the microlens masses or the component velocities. That time delays in lensed quasars are themselves time variable likely explains why repeated delay measurements of individual lensed quasars appear to vary by more than their estimated uncertainties. This effect is also a new important systematic problem for attempts to use time delays in lensed quasars for cosmology or to detect substructures (satellites) in lens galaxies.},

The R-band light curves of the four individual images of the quasar were obtained using deconvolution photometry for a total of 707 epochs. Several sharp quasar variability features strongly constrain the time delays between the quasar images. Using three different numerical techniques, we measured these delays for all possible pairs of quasar images while always processing the four light curves simultaneously. For all three methods, the delays between the three close images A, B, and C are compatible with being 0, while we measured the delay of image D to be 91 days, with a fractional uncertainty of 1.5\% (1σ), including systematic errors. Our analysis of random and systematic errors accounts in a realistic way for the observed quasar variability, fluctuating microlensing magnification over a broad range of temporal scales, noise properties, and seasonal gaps.

	abstract = {Measuring time delays between the multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars is now recognized as a competitive way to constrain the cosmological parameters, and it is complementary with other cosmological probes. This requires long and well sampled optical light curves of numerous lensed quasars, such as those obtained by the {COSMOGRAIL} collaboration. High-quality data from our monitoring campaign call for novel numerical techniques to robustly measure the delays, as well as the associated random and systematic uncertainties, even in the presence of microlensing variations. We propose three different point estimators to measure time delays, which are explicitly designed to handle light curves with extrinsic variability. These methods share a common formalism, which enables them to process data from n-image lenses. Since the estimators rely on significantly contrasting ideas, we expect them to be sensitive to different bias sources. For each method and data set, we empirically estimate both the precision and accuracy (bias) of the time delay measurement using simulated light curves with known time delays that closely mimic the observations. Finally, we test the self-consistency of our approach, and we demonstrate that our bias estimation is serviceable. These new methods, including the empirical uncertainty estimator, will represent the standard benchmark for analyzing the {COSMOGRAIL} light curves.},

	abstract = {Under the assumption of a flat Λ{CDM} cosmology, recent data from the Planck satellite point toward a Hubble constant that is in tension with that measured by gravitational lens time delays and by the local distance ladder. Prosaically, this difference could arise from unknown systematic uncertainties in some of the measurements. More interestingly—if systematics were ruled out—resolving the tension would require a departure from the flat Λ{CDM} cosmology, introducing, for example, a modest amount of spatial curvature, or a non-trivial dark energy equation of state. To begin to address these issues, we present an analysis of the gravitational lens {RXJ}1131-1231 that is improved in one particular regard: we examine the issue of systematic error introduced by an assumed lens model density profile. We use more flexible gravitational lens models with baryonic and dark matter components, and find that the exquisite Hubble Space Telescope image with thousands of intensity pixels in the Einstein ring and the stellar velocity dispersion of the lens contain sufficient information to constrain these more flexible models. The total uncertainty on the time-delay distance is 6.6\% for a single system. We proceed to combine our improved time-delay distance measurement with the {WMAP}9 and Planck posteriors. In an open Λ{CDM} model, the data for {RXJ}1131-1231 in combination with Planck favor a flat universe with Ω \_k=0.00{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.01{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.02{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} (68\% credible interval ({CI})).

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 ± 15 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens' environment. Our analysis of the {HST} images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope γ' and the external convergence κ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The {HST} images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density profile logarithmic slope to be γ' = 2.08 ± 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field provides an estimate of the prior for κ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}: 0.10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.08{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.05{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. This latter distribution dominates the final uncertainty on H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. Fixing the cosmological parameters at Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.3, Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.7, and w = -1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we find H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 70.6{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+3.1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-3.1{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over κ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ext{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ({WMAP}) five-year data set, we find that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} at w = -1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 \&lt; Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}k{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.009 (95\% {CL}), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia {SNe} sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in combination with {WMAP}, H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 69.7{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+4.9{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-5.0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} and w = -0.94{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.17{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.19{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} (68\% {CL}), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do.

We present a blind analysis of the gravitational lens {RXJ}1131-1231 incorporating (1) the newly measured time delays from {COSMOGRAIL}, the {COSmological} {MOnitoring} of {GRAvItational} Lenses, (2) archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the lens system, (3) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of the lens galaxy of 323 ± 20 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} based on Keck spectroscopy, and (4) a characterization of the line-of-sight structures via observations of the lens' environment and ray tracing through the Millennium Simulation. Our blind analysis is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The joint analysis of the data sets allows a time-delay distance measurement to 6\% precision that takes into account all known systematic uncertainties. In combination with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe seven-year ({WMAP}7) data set in flat {wCDM} cosmology, our unblinded cosmological constraints for {RXJ}1131-1231 are H\_0=80.0{\textasciicircum}\{+5.8\}\_\{-5.7\} km s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}, Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}de{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 0.79 ± 0.03, and w=-1.25{\textasciicircum}\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.21\}. We find the results to be statistically consistent with those from the analysis of the gravitational lens B1608+656, permitting us to combine the inferences from these two lenses.

Time-delay lenses constrain especially tightly the Hubble constant H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} (5.7\% and 4.0\% respectively in {wCDM} and open Λ{CDM}) and curvature of the universe. The overall information content is similar to that of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation experiments. Thus, they complement well other cosmological probes, and provide an independent check of unknown systematics. Our measurement of the Hubble constant is completely independent of those based on the local distance ladder method, providing an important consistency check of the standard cosmological model and of general relativity.},

In October 2012, {NASA} chartered a Science Definition Team ({SDT}) to produce, in collaboration with the {WFIRST} Project Office at {GSFC} and the Program Office at {JPL}, a Design Reference Mission ({DRM}) for an implementation of {WFIRST} using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality mirror assemblies recently made available to {NASA}. This {DRM} builds on the work of the earlier {WFIRST} {SDT}, reported by Green et al. (2012). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of {WFIRST} as a Guest Observer facility.

Stellar kinematics of the deflector galaxy play an essential role in this measurement by: (i) helping break the mass-sheet degeneracy; (ii) determining in principle the angular diameter distance D{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}d{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to the deflector and thus further improving the cosmological constraints. In this paper we simulate observations of lensed quasars with integral field spectrographs and show that spatially resolved kinematics of the deflector enables further progress by helping break the mass-anisotropy degeneracy. Furthermore, we use our simulations to obtain realistic error estimates with current/upcoming instruments like {OSIRIS} on Keck and {NIRSPEC} on the James Webb Space Telescope for both distances (typically ̃6 per cent on D{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}∆t{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and ̃10 per cent on D{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}d{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}). We use the error estimates to compute cosmological forecasts for the sample of nine lenses that currently have well-measured time delays and deep Hubble Space Telescope images and for a sample of 40 lenses that is projected to be available in a few years through follow-up of candidates found in ongoing wide field surveys. We find that H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} can be measured with 2 per cent (1 per cent) precision from nine (40) lenses in a flat Λcold dark matter cosmology. We study several other cosmological models beyond the flat Λcold dark matter model and find that time-delay lenses with spatially resolved kinematics can greatly improve the precision of the cosmological parameters measured by cosmic microwave background data.},

Our new catalogue triples the number of known galaxy redshifts in the direct vicinity of the lens, expanding to 102 the number of measured redshifts for galaxies separated by less than 3 arcmin from the lens. We complement our catalogue with literature data to gather redshifts up to 15 arcmin from the lens, and search for galaxy groups or clusters projected towards {HE} 0435-1223. We confirm that the lens is a member of a small group that includes at least 12 galaxies, and find 8 other group candidates near the line of sight of the lens. The flexion shift, namely the shift of lensed images produced by high-order perturbation of the lens potential, is calculated for each galaxy/group and used to identify which objects produce the largest perturbation of the lens potential. This analysis demonstrates that (I) at most three of the five brightest galaxies projected within 12 arcsec of the lens need to be explicitly used in the lens models, and ({II}) the groups can be treated in the lens model as an external tidal field (shear) contribution.},

	abstract = {We present the full sample of 118 galaxy-scale strong-lens candidates in the Sloan Lens {ACS} ({SLACS}) Survey for the Masses (S4TM) Survey, which are spectroscopically selected from the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}) imaging observations confirm that 40 candidates are definite strong lenses with multiple lensed images. The foreground-lens galaxies are found to be early-type galaxies ({ETGs}) at redshifts 0.06-0.44, and background sources are emission-line galaxies at redshifts 0.22-1.29. As an extension of the {SLACS} Survey, the S4TM Survey is the first attempt to preferentially search for strong-lens systems with relatively lower lens masses than those in the pre-existing strong-lens samples. By fitting {HST} data with a singular isothermal ellipsoid model, we find that the total projected mass within the Einstein radius of the S4TM strong-lens sample ranges from 3 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to 2 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}11{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. In Shu et al., we have derived the total stellar mass of the S4TM lenses to be 5 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to 1 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}12{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. Both the total enclosed mass and stellar mass of the S4TM lenses are on average almost a factor of 2 smaller than those of the {SLACS} lenses, which also represent the typical mass scales of the current strong-lens samples. The extended mass coverage provided by the S4TM sample can enable a direct test, with the aid of strong lensing, for transitions in scaling relations, kinematic properties, mass structure, and dark-matter content trends of {ETGs} at intermediate-mass scales as noted in previous studies. Based on observations made with the {NASA}/{ESA} Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}), obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by {AURA}, Inc., under {NASA} contract {NAS} 5-26555.

	abstract = {We propose a new strategy of finding strongly lensed supernovae ({SNe}) by monitoring known galaxy-scale strong-lens systems. Strongly lensed {SNe} are potentially powerful tools for the study of cosmology, galaxy evolution, and stellar populations, but they are extremely rare. By targeting known strongly lensed star-forming galaxies, our strategy significantly boosts the detection efficiency for lensed {SNe} compared to a blind search. As a reference sample, we compile the 128 galaxy-galaxy strong-lens systems from the Sloan Lens {ACS} Survey ({SLACS}), the {SLACS} for the Masses Survey, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Emission-Line Lens Survey. Within this sample, we estimate the rates of strongly lensed Type Ia {SN} ({SNIa}) and core-collapse {SN} ({CCSN}) to be 1.23 ± 0.12 and 10.4 ± 1.1 events per year, respectively. The lensed {SN} images are expected to be widely separated with a median separation of 2 arcsec. Assuming a conservative fiducial lensing magnification factor of 5 for the most highly magnified {SN} image, we forecast that a monitoring program with a single-visit depth of 24.7 mag (5σ point source, r band) and a cadence of 5 days can detect 0.49 strongly lensed {SNIa} event and 2.1 strongly lensed {CCSN} events per year within this sample. Our proposed targeted-search strategy is particularly useful for prompt and efficient identifications and follow-up observations of strongly lensed {SN} candidates. It also allows telescopes with small fields of view and limited time to efficiently discover strongly lensed {SNe} with a pencil-beam scanning strategy.},

Here we review the experiments in the 2020s that will yield orders of magnitudes more {SNe} Ia, and the new understandings and capabilities to constrain systematic uncertainties at a level to match these statistics. We then discuss five different cosmological probes with {SNe} Ia: the conventional Hubble diagram for measuring dark energy properties, the distance ladder for measuring the Hubble constant, peculiar velocities and weak lensing for measuring sigma8 and strong-lens measurements of H0 and other cosmological parameters. For each of these probes, we discuss the experiments that will provide the best measurements and also the {SN} Ia-related systematics that affect each one.},

	abstract = {The main obstacle that gravitational lensing has in determining accurate masses of deflectors, or in determining precise estimates for the Hubble constant, is the degeneracy of lensing observables with respect to the mass-sheet transformation ({MST}). The {MST} is a global modification of the mass distribution which leaves all image positions, shapes, and flux ratios invariant, but which changes the time delay. Here we show that another global transformation of lensing mass distributions exists which leaves image positions and flux ratios almost invariant, and of which the {MST} is a special case. As is the case for the {MST}, this new transformation only applies if one considers only those source components that are at the same distance from us. Whereas for axi-symmetric lenses this source position transformation exactly reproduces all strong lensing observables, it does so only approximately for more general lens situations. We provide crude estimates for the accuracy with which the transformed mass distribution can reproduce the same image positions as the original lens model, and present an illustrative example of its performance. This new invariance transformation is most likely the reason why the same strong lensing information can be accounted for with rather different mass models.},

	abstract = {The light travel time differences in strong gravitational lensing systems allows an independent determination of the Hubble constant. This method has been successfully applied to several lens systems. The formally most precise measurements are, however, in tension with the recent determination of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} from the Planck satellite for a spatially flat six-parameters Λ{CDM} cosmology. We reconsider the uncertainties of the method, concerning the mass profile of the lens galaxies, and show that the formal precision relies on the assumption that the mass profile is a perfect power law. Simple analytical arguments and numerical experiments reveal that mass-sheet like transformations yield significant freedom in choosing the mass profile, even when exquisite Einstein rings are observed. Furthermore, the characterization of the environment of the lens does not break that degeneracy which is not physically linked to extrinsic convergence. We present an illustrative example where the multiple imaging properties of a composite (baryons + dark matter) lens can be extremely well reproduced by a power-law model having the same velocity dispersion, but with predictions for the Hubble constant that deviate by {\textasciitilde}20\%. Hence we conclude that the impact of degeneracies between parametrized models have been underestimated in current H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurements from lensing, and need to be carefully reconsidered.},

The first four observed images of {SN} Refsdal (images S1-S4) exhibited a slow rise (over ̃150 days) to reach a broad peak brightness around 2015 April 20. Using a set of light curve templates constructed from {SN} 1987A-like peculiar Type {II} {SNe}, we measure time delays for the four images relative to S1 of 4 ± 4 (for S2), 2 ± 5 (S3), and 24 ± 7 days (S4). The measured magnification ratios relative to S1 are 1.15 ± 0.05 (S2), 1.01 ± 0.04 (S3), and 0.34 ± 0.02 (S4). None of the template light curves fully captures the photometric behavior of {SN} Refsdal, so we also derive complementary measurements for these parameters using polynomials to represent the intrinsic light curve shape. These more flexible fits deliver fully consistent time delays of 7 ± 2 (S2), 0.6 ± 3 (S3), and 27 ± 8 days (S4). The lensing magnification ratios are similarly consistent, measured as 1.17 ± 0.02 (S2), 1.00 ± 0.01 (S3), and 0.38 ± 0.02 (S4). We compare these measurements against published predictions from lens models, and find that the majority of model predictions are in very good agreement with our measurements. Finally, we discuss avenues for future improvement of time delay measurements—both for {SN} Refsdal and for other strongly lensed {SNe} yet to come.},

These {SNe} were observed using the {HST} Wide Field Camera 3 infrared detector, with imaging in both wide- and medium-band filters. We demonstrate that the classification and redshift estimates are significantly improved by the inclusion of single-epoch medium-band observations. This medium-band imaging approximates a very low resolution spectrum (λ/∆λ ≲ 100) which can isolate broad spectral absorption features that differentiate {SNe} Ia from their most common core collapse cousins. This medium-band method is also insensitive to dust extinction and (unlike grism spectroscopy) it is not affected by contamination from the {SN} host galaxy or other nearby sources. As such, it can provide a more efficient—though less precise—alternative to {IR} spectroscopy for high-z {SNe}.},

Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae ({SNe}) of all types, out to z {\textasciitilde} 2.5. We classify {\textasciitilde}24 of these as Type Ia {SNe} ({SNe} Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts and {SN} photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of six {SNe}). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric {SN} Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the first time beyond z = 2 and putting new constraints on {SN} Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of {SNe} that exploded when the universe was only {\textasciitilde}3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history. This gives the {CANDELS} high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of {SNe} Ia that explode promptly after formation (\&lt;500 Myr).

However, mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both {CANDELS} and the sister {HST} program {CLASH} (Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble), we find a low rate of {SNe} Ia at z \&gt; 1.

This observed magnification provides a rare opportunity for a direct empirical test of galaxy cluster lens models. Here we test 17 lens models, 13 of which were generated before the {SN} magnification was known, qualifying as pure “blind tests.” The models are collectively fairly accurate: 8 of the models deliver median magnifications that are consistent with the measured μ to within 1σ. However, there is a subtle systematic bias: the significant disagreements all involve models overpredicting the magnification. We evaluate possible causes for this mild bias, and find no single physical or methodological explanation to account for it. We do find that model accuracy can be improved to some extent with stringent quality cuts on multiply imaged systems, such as requiring that a large fraction have spectroscopic redshifts. In addition to testing model accuracies as we have done here, Type Ia {SN} magnifications could also be used as inputs for future lens models of Abell 2744 and other clusters, providing valuable constraints in regions where traditional strong- and weak-lensing information is unavailable.},

The bulk of this improvement comes from new near-infrared ({NIR}) observations of Cepheid variables in 11 host galaxies of recent type Ia supernovae ({SNe} Ia), more than doubling the sample of reliable {SNe} Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance to a total of 19; these in turn leverage the magnitude-redshift relation based on ̃300 {SNe} Ia at z \&lt; 0.15. All 19 hosts as well as the megamaser system {NGC} 4258 have been observed with {WFC}3 in the optical and {NIR}, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors in the relative distance estimates from Cepheids. Other noteworthy improvements include a 33\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to {NGC} 4258, a larger sample of Cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud ({LMC}), a more robust distance to the {LMC} based on late-type detached eclipsing binaries ({DEBs}), {HST} observations of Cepheids in M31, and new {HST}-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way ({MW}) Cepheids.

Evolutionary effects remain the most uncertain contributor to the overall systematic error budget. Present plans to probe evolution with cosmology-independent explosion parameters could yield an absence of evidence for evolution without definitive evidence of its absence. Here we show that observations of Type Ia supernovae in the redshift interval 1.5\&lt;z\&lt;3.0, where dark-energy-dependent effects are relatively negligible, should provide direct evidence to discern evolutionary effects. As examples of our approach to constraining evolution, we examine the impact of changing progenitor metallicity and age on the degree of potential luminosity evolution. We show that the observations we propose can be carried out by existing space telescopes, or ones that are already under development.},

The luminosity distances of these objects are determined by methods that employ relations between {SN} Ia luminosity and light curve shape. Combined with previous data from our High-z Supernova Search Team and recent results by Riess et al., this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and a set of 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the following cosmological parameters: the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (i.e., the vacuum energy density, Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift {SNe} Ia are, on average, 10\%-15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M = 0.2) universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, {SN} Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 \&lt; 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M \&gt;= 0, the spectroscopically confirmed {SNe} Ia are statistically consistent with q\_0 \&lt; 0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two different fitting methods, respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M = 0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level from one of the two methods. For a flat universe prior (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1), the spectroscopically confirmed {SNe} Ia require Omega\_Lambda \&gt; 0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma formal statistical significance for the two different fitting methods. A universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M = 1) is formally ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma confidence level for the two different fitting methods. We estimate the dynamical age of the universe to be 14.2 +/- 1.7 Gyr including systematic uncertainties in the current Cepheid distance scale. We estimate the likely effect of several sources of systematic error, including progenitor and metallicity evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local perturbations in the expansion rate, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects appear to reconcile the data with Omega\_Lambda = 0 and q\_0 \&gt;= 0.},

In time-domain astronomy, imaging programmes with a short cadence are able to detect rapidly evolving transients, previously unseen by surveys designed for slowly evolving supernovae. Here, we describe two unusual transient events discovered in a Hubble Space Telescope programme that combined these techniques with high-cadence imaging on a field with a strong-lensing galaxy cluster. These transients were faster and fainter than any supernovae, but substantially more luminous than a classical nova. We find that they can be explained as separate eruptions of a luminous blue variable star or a recurrent nova, or as an unrelated pair of stellar microlensing events. To distinguish between these hypotheses will require clarification of the cluster lens models, along with more high-cadence imaging of the field that could detect related transient episodes. This discovery suggests that the intersection of strong lensing with high-cadence transient surveys may be a fruitful path for future astrophysical transient studies.},

We construct a refined sample of more than 100 multiple images for each cluster by taking advantage of the full-depth {HFF} images, and conduct mass modeling using the glafic software, which assumes simply parametrized mass distributions. Our mass modeling also exploits a magnification constraint from the lensed {SN} Ia {HFF}14Tom for Abell 2744 and positional constraints from the multiple images S1-S4 of the lensed supernova {SN} Refsdal for {MACS} J1149.6+2223. We find that our best-fitting mass models reproduce the observed image positions with rms errors of ̃0.″4, which are smaller than rms errors in previous mass modeling that adopted similar numbers of multiple images. Our model predicts a new image of {SN} Refsdal with a relative time delay and magnification that are fully consistent with a recent detection of reappearance. We then construct catalogs of z ̃ 6-9 dropout galaxies behind the four clusters and estimate magnification factors for these dropout galaxies with our best-fitting mass models. The dropout sample from the four cluster fields contains ̃120 galaxies at z ≳ 6, about 20 of which are predicted to be magnified by a factor of more than 10. Some of the high-redshift galaxies detected in the {HFF} have lensing-corrected magnitudes of M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{UV}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} ̃ -15 to -14. Our analysis demonstrates that the {HFF} data indeed offer an ideal opportunity to study faint high-redshift galaxies.

From the grism spectrum, we measure an Hα expansion velocity consistent with those of {SN} 1987A-like {SNe} at a similar phase. The luminosity, evolution, and Gaussian profile of the Hα emission of the {WFC}3 and X-shooter spectra, separated by ̃2.5 months in the rest frame, provide additional evidence that supports the {SN} 1987A-like classification. In comparison with other examples of {SN} 1987A-like {SNe}, photometry of {SN} Refsdal favors bluer B - V and V - R colors and one of the largest luminosities for the assumed range of potential magnifications. The evolution of the light curve at late times will provide additional evidence about the potential existence of any substantial circumstellar material.

We use these data and the light curve from the first four observed images of {SN} Refsdal to place constraints on the relative time delay and magnification of the new image ({SX}) compared to images S1-S4. This enables us, for the first time, to test “blind” lens model predictions of both magnifications and time delays for a lensed {SN}. We find that the timing and brightness of the new image are consistent with the blind predictions of a fraction of the models. The reappearance illustrates the discriminatory power of this blind test and its utility to uncover sources of systematic uncertainty. From planned {HST} photometry, we expect to reach a precision of 1\%-2\% on the time delay between S1-S4 and {SX}.},

Probabilistic classification is more appropriate for such data but is incompatible with the traditional metrics used on deterministic classifications. Furthermore, large survey collaborations like {LSST} intend to use the resulting classification probabilities for diverse science objectives, indicating a need for a metric that balances a variety of goals. We describe the process used to develop an optimal performance metric for an open classification challenge that seeks to identify probabilistic classifiers that can serve many scientific interests. The Photometric {LSST} Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge ({PLASTICC}) aims to identify promising techniques for obtaining classification probabilities of transient and variable objects by engaging a broader community beyond astronomy. Using mock classification probability submissions emulating realistically complex archetypes of those anticipated of {PLASTICC}, we compare the sensitivity of two metrics of classification probabilities under various weighting schemes, finding that both yield results that are qualitatively consistent with intuitive notions of classification performance. We thus choose as a metric for {PLASTICC} a weighted modification of the cross-entropy because it can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of information content. Finally, we propose extensions of our methodology to ever more complex challenge goals and suggest some guiding principles for approaching the choice of a metric of probabilistic data products.},

In the next decade, transient searches from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) and the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope ({WFIRST}) will accelerate this growth, increasing the {SNIa} sample to several hundred thousand. This {HST}-{AR} program will provide an important tool for the next era of {SNIa} cosmology by developing {SALT}3 - a new {SN} Ia model that extends the widely-used {SALT}2 model to near-infrared wavelengths. We will add the relatively small but powerful dataset of {ACS} and {WFC}3-{IR} observations to a large number of ground-based light curves for model training purposes. The addition of {HST} data is necessary to push the new model beyond 11000 Angstrom, and will be particularly valuable for improving and extending the {SALT}2 color law that is presently trained to only 6000 Angstrom.},

These events were detected and their multi-colour light curves measured using the {MegaPrime}/{MegaCam} instrument at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope ({CFHT}), by repeatedly imaging four one-square degree fields in four bands. Follow-up spectroscopy was performed at the {VLT}, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm the nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshifts. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Methods: Systematic uncertainties arising from light curve modeling are studied, making use of two techniques to derive the peak magnitude, shape and colour of the supernovae, and taking advantage of a precise calibration of the {SNLS} fields. {\textless}{BR} /{\textgreater} Results: A flat Λ{CDM} cosmological fit to 231 {SNLS} high redshift type Ia supernovae alone gives Ω\_M = 0.211 ± 0.034(stat) ± 0.069(sys). The dominant systematic uncertainty comes from uncertainties in the photometric calibration. Systematic uncertainties from light curve fitters come next with a total contribution of ±0.026 on Ω\_M.

It is now a {NASA} mission in formulation with a planned launch in the mid 2020s. A primary mission objective is to precisely constrain the nature of dark energy through multiple probes, including Type Ia supernovae ({SN} Ia). Here, we present the first realistic simulations of the {WFIRST} {SN} survey based on current hardware specifications and using open-source tools. We simulate {SN} light curves and spectra as viewed by the {WFIRST} wide-field channel ({WFC}) imager and integral field channel ({IFC}) spectrometer, respectively. We examine 11 survey strategies with different time allocations between the {WFC} and {IFC}, two of which are based upon the strategy described by the {WFIRST} Science Definition Team, which measures {SN} distances exclusively from {IFC} data. We propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties to predict the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit ({FoM}) for each strategy. Of the strategies investigated, we find the most successful to be {WFC} focused. However, further work in constraining systematics is required to fully optimize the use of the {IFC}. Even without improvements to other cosmological probes, the {WFIRST} {SN} survey has the potential to increase the {FoM} by more than an order of magnitude from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented here have not been fully optimized, these initial investigations are an important step in the development of the final hardware design and implementation of the {WFIRST} mission.},

It is a space observatory that will address the most compelling scientific problems in dark energy, exoplanets and general astrophysics using a 2.4-m telescope with a wide-field infrared instrument and an optical coronagraph. The Astro2010 Decadal Survey recommended a Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope as its top priority for a new large space mission. As conceived by the decadal survey, {WFIRST} would carry out a dark energy science program, a microlensing program to determine the demographics of exoplanets, and a general observing program utilizing its ultra wide field. In October 2012, {NASA} chartered a Science Definition Team ({SDT}) to produce, in collaboration with the {WFIRST} Study Office at {GSFC} and the Program Office at {JPL}, a Design Reference Mission ({DRM}) for an implementation of {WFIRST} using one of the 2.4-m, Hubble-quality telescope assemblies recently made available to {NASA}. This {DRM} builds on the work of the earlier {WFIRST} {SDT}, reported by Green et al. (2012) and the previous {WFIRST}-2.4 {DRM}, reported by Spergel et. (2013). The 2.4-m primary mirror enables a mission with greater sensitivity and higher angular resolution than the 1.3-m and 1.1-m designs considered previously, increasing both the science return of the primary surveys and the capabilities of {WFIRST} as a Guest Observer facility. The addition of an on-axis coronagraphic instrument to the baseline design enables imaging and spectroscopic studies of planets around nearby stars.},

	abstract = {A galaxy cluster acts as a cosmic telescope over background galaxies but also as a cosmic microscope magnifying the imperfections of the lens. The diverging magnification of lensing caustics enhances the microlensing effect of substructure present within the lensing mass. Fine-scale structure can be accessed as a moving background source brightens and disappears when crossing these caustics. The recent discovery of a distant lensed star near the Einstein radius of the galaxy cluster {MACSJ}1149.5+2223 allows a rare opportunity to reach subsolar-mass microlensing through a supercritical column of cluster matter. Here we compare these observations with high-resolution ray-tracing simulations that include stellar microlensing set by the observed intracluster starlight and also primordial black holes that may be responsible for the recently observed {LIGO} events. We explore different scenarios with microlenses from the intracluster medium and black holes, including primordial ones, and examine strategies to exploit these unique alignments. We find that the best constraints on the fraction of compact dark matter ({DM}) in the small-mass regime can be obtained in regions of the cluster where the intracluster medium plays a negligible role. This new lensing phenomenon should be widespread and can be detected within modest-redshift lensed galaxies so that the luminosity distance is not prohibitive for detecting individual magnified stars. High-cadence Hubble Space Telescope monitoring of several such optimal arcs will be rewarded by an unprecedented mass spectrum of compact objects that can contribute to uncovering the nature of {DM}.},

	abstract = {We present optical light curves, redshifts, and classifications for 365 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae ({SNe} Ia) discovered by the Pan-{STARRS}1 ({PS}1) Medium Deep Survey. We detail improvements to the {PS}1 {SN} photometry, astrometry, and calibration that reduce the systematic uncertainties in the {PS}1 {SN} Ia distances. We combine the subset of 279 {PS}1 {SNe} Ia (0.03 \&lt; z \&lt; 0.68) with useful distance estimates of {SNe} Ia from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS}), {SNLS}, and various low-z and Hubble Space Telescope samples to form the largest combined sample of {SNe} Ia, consisting of a total of 1048 {SNe} Ia in the range of 0.01 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.3, which we call the “Pantheon Sample.” When combining Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) measurements with the Pantheon {SN} sample, we find \{\{\{Ω \}\}\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.307+/- 0.012 and w=-1.026+/- 0.041 for the {wCDM} model. When the {SN} and {CMB} constraints are combined with constraints from {BAO} and local H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurements, the analysis yields the most precise measurement of dark energy to date: \{w\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=-1.007+/- 0.089 and \{w\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}a{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=-0.222+/- 0.407 for the \{w\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\{w\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}a{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{CDM} model. Tension with a cosmological constant previously seen in an analysis of {PS}1 and low-z {SNe} has diminished after an increase of 2× in the statistics of the {PS}1 sample, improved calibration and photometry, and stricter light-curve quality cuts. We find that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements of dark energy are almost as large as the statistical uncertainties, primarily due to limitations of modeling the low-redshift sample. This must be addressed for future progress in using {SNe} Ia to measure dark energy.},

Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Wide Field Camera 3 on the Hubble Space Telescope ({HST}), we have imaged 25 galaxy-cluster fields and parallel fields of non-cluster galaxies. We report a sample of 27 {SNe} discovered in the parallel fields. Of these {SNe}, {\textasciitilde}13 are classified as {SN} Ia candidates, including four {SN} Ia candidates at redshifts z \&gt; 1.2. We measure volumetric {SN} Ia rates to redshift 1.8 and add the first upper limit on the {SN} Ia rate in the range 1.8 \&lt; z \&lt; 2.4. The results are consistent with the rates measured by the {HST}/{GOODS} and Subaru Deep Field {SN} surveys. We model these results together with previous measurements at z \&lt; 1 from the literature. The best-fitting {SN} Ia delay-time distribution ({DTD}; the distribution of times that elapse between a short burst of star formation and subsequent {SN} Ia explosions) is a power law with an index of -1.00{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06(0.09)\}\_\{-0.06(0.10)\}{\textbackslash} (statistical) {\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}\_\{-0.08\}{\textbackslash} (systematic), where the statistical uncertainty is a result of the 68\% and 95\% (in parentheses) statistical uncertainties reported for the various {SN} Ia rates (from this work and from the literature), and the systematic uncertainty reflects the range of possible cosmic star-formation histories. We also test {DTD} models produced by an assortment of published binary population synthesis ({BPS}) simulations. The shapes of all {BPS} double-degenerate {DTDs} are consistent with the volumetric {SN} Ia measurements, when the {DTD} models are scaled up by factors of 3-9. In contrast, all {BPS} single-degenerate {DTDs} are ruled out by the measurements at \&gt;99\% significance level.},

A sample of 27 low-redshift {SNe} Ia with well-observed {NIR} light curves observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project ({CSP}) between 2004 and 2007 is used. All 27 objects have premaximum coverage in optical bands, with a subset of 13 having premaximum {NIR} observations as well; coverage of the other 14 begins shortly after {NIR} maximum brightness. We describe the methods used to derive light-curve parameters (absolute peak magnitudes and decline rates) from both spline- and template-fitting procedures, and we confirm prior findings that fitting templates to {SNe} Ia light curves in the {NIR} is problematic due to the diversity of postmaximum behavior of objects that are characterized by similar ∆m{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}15{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}(B) values, especially at high decline rates. Nevertheless, we show that {NIR} light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially if the observations begin within 5 days after {NIR} maximum. {SNe} Ia appear to be better “standardizable candles” in the {NIR} bands than in the optical bands. For the subset of 13 objects in our data set that excludes the highly reddened and fast-declining {SNe} Ia and includes only those objects for which {NIR} observations began prior to 5 days after maximum light, we find modest (1.7σ) evidence for a peak-luminosity versus decline-rate relation in Y, and stronger evidence (2.8σ) in J and H. Using R{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}V{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} values differing from the canonical value (R{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}V{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 3.1) is shown to have little effect on the results. A Hubble diagram is presented for the {NIR} bands and the B band. The resulting scatter for the combined {NIR} bands is 0.13 mag, while the B band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. Finally, we find evidence for a bimodal distribution in the {NIR} absolute magnitudes of fast-declining {SNe} Ia [∆m{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}15{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}(B) \&gt; 1.7]. These data suggest that applying a correction to {SNe} Ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to be beneficial in the J and H bands to make {SNe} Ia more precise distance indicators, but of only marginal importance in the Y band.},

The Foundation Supernova Survey is designed to lower these uncertainties by creating a new sample of z \&lt; 0.1 {SNe} Ia observed on the Pan-{STARRS} system. Here we combine the Foundation sample with {SNe} from the Pan-{STARRS} Medium Deep Survey and measure cosmological parameters with 1338 {SNe} from a single telescope and a single, well-calibrated photometric system. For the first time, both the low-z and high-z data are predominantly discovered by surveys that do not target preselected galaxies, reducing selection bias uncertainties. The z \&gt; 0.1 data include 875 {SNe} without spectroscopic classifications, and we show that we can robustly marginalize over {CC} {SN} contamination. We measure Foundation Hubble residuals to be fainter than the preexisting low-z Hubble residuals by 0.046 ± 0.027 mag (stat + sys). By combining the {SN} Ia data with cosmic microwave background constraints, we find w = −0.938 ± 0.053, consistent with Λ{CDM}. With 463 spectroscopically classified {SNe} Ia alone, we measure w = −0.933 ± 0.061. Using the more homogeneous and better-characterized Foundation sample gives a 55\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty attributed to {SN} Ia sample selection biases. Although use of just a single photometric system at low and high redshift increases the impact of photometric calibration uncertainties in this analysis, previous low-z samples may have correlated calibration uncertainties that were neglected in past studies. The full Foundation sample will observe up to 800 {SNe} to anchor the {LSST} and {WFIRST} Hubble diagrams.},

Though most Pan-{STARRS} {SNe} lack spectroscopic classifications, in a previous paper we demonstrated that photometrically classified {SNe} can be used to infer unbiased cosmological parameters by using a Bayesian methodology that marginalizes over core-collapse ({CC}) {SN} contamination. Our sample contains nearly twice as many {SNe} as the largest previous {SN} Ia compilation. Combining {SNe} with cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) constraints from Planck, we measure the dark energy equation-of-state parameter w to be -0.989 ± 0.057 (stat+sys). If w evolves with redshift as w(a) = w {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} + w {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater} a {\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}(1 - a), we find w {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = -0.912 ± 0.149 and w {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater} a {\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = -0.513 ± 0.826. These results are consistent with cosmological parameters from the Joint Light-curve Analysis and the Pantheon sample. We try four different photometric classification priors for Pan-{STARRS} {SNe} and two alternate ways of modeling {CC} {SN} contamination, finding that no variant gives a w differing by more than 2\% from the baseline measurement. The systematic uncertainty on w due to marginalizing over {CC} {SN} contamination, \{σ \}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}w{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}{CC}{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}\}=0.012, is the third-smallest source of systematic uncertainty in this work. We find limited (1.6σ) evidence for evolution of the {SN} color-luminosity relation with redshift, a possible systematic that could constitute a significant uncertainty in future high-z analyses. Our data provide one of the best current constraints on w, demonstrating that samples with ̃5\% {CC} {SN} contamination can give competitive cosmological constraints when the contaminating distribution is marginalized over in a Bayesian framework.},

	abstract = {This paper presents new deep and wide narrow-band surveys undertaken with United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ({UKIRT}), Subaru and the Very Large Telescope ({VLT}), a unique combined effort to select large, robust samples of Hα star-forming galaxies at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23 (corresponding to look-back times of 4.2, 7.0, 9.2 and 10.6 Gyr) in a uniform manner over ̃2 deg{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} in the Cosmological Evolution Survey and Ultra Deep Survey fields. The deep multi-epoch Hα surveys reach a matched 3σ flux limit of ≈3 M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} yr{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} out to z = 2.2 for the first time, while the wide area and the coverage over two independent fields allow us to greatly overcome cosmic variance and assemble by far the largest samples of Hα emitters. Catalogues are presented for a total of 1742, 637, 515 and 807 Hα emitters, robustly selected at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23, respectively, and used to determine the Hα luminosity function and its evolution. The faint-end slope of the Hα luminosity function is found to be α = -1.60 ± 0.08 over z = 0-2.23, showing no significant evolution. The characteristic luminosity of star-forming galaxies, L*{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Hα{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, evolves significantly as log L*{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Hα{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}(z) = 0.45z + log L*{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}z = 0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. This is the first time Hα has been used to trace star formation activity with a single homogeneous survey at z = 0.4-2.23. Overall, the evolution seen with Hα is in good agreement with the evolution seen using inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as far-infrared and ultraviolet, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the evolution in the last 11 Gyr being driven by a statistically similar star-forming population across cosmic time, but with a strong luminosity increase from z ̃ 0 to ̃2.2. Our uniform analysis allows us to derive the Hα star formation history ({SFRH}) of the Universe, showing a clear rise up to z ̃ 2.2, for which the simple parametrization log{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}ρ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{SFR}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = -2.1(1 + z){\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} is valid over 80 per cent of the age of the Universe. The results reveal that both the shape and normalization of the Hα {SFRH} are consistent with the measurements of the stellar mass density growth, confirming that our Hα {SFRH} is tracing the bulk of the formation of stars in the Universe for z \&lt; 2.23. The star formation activity over the last ̃11 Gyr is responsible for producing ̃95 per cent of the total stellar mass density observed locally, with half of that being assembled in 2 Gyr between z = 1.2 and 2.2, and the other half in 8 Gyr (since z \&lt; 1.2). If the star formation rate density continues to decline with time in the same way as seen in the past ̃11 Gyr, then the stellar mass density of the Universe will reach a maximum which is only 5 per cent higher than the present-day value.},

In this work we present predictions from a galaxy formation model, Galacticus, for the cumulative number counts of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$-emitting galaxies. We couple Galacticus to three different dust attenuation methods and examine the counts using each method. A \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ minimisation approach is used to compare the model predictions to observed galaxy counts and calibrate the dust parameters. We find that weak dust attenuation is required for the Galacticus counts to be broadly consistent with the observations, though the optimum dust parameters return large values for \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$, suggesting that further calibration of Galacticus is necessary. The model predictions are also consistent with observed estimates for the optical depth and the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ luminosity function. Finally we present forecasts for the redshift distributions and number counts for two Euclid-like and one {WFIRST}-like survey.

	abstract = {We present the {WFC}3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel ({WISP}) Survey. {WISP} is obtaining slitless, near-infrared grism spectroscopy of {\textasciitilde}90 independent, high-latitude fields by observing in the pure-parallel mode with the Wide Field Camera Three on the Hubble Space Telescope for a total of {\textasciitilde}250 orbits. Spectra are obtained with the G {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}102{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} (λ = 0.8-1.17 μm, R {\textasciitilde}210) and G {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}141{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} grisms (λ = 1.11-1.67 μm, R {\textasciitilde}130), together with direct imaging in the J and H bands (F110W and F140W, respectively). In the present paper, we present the first results from 19 {WISP} fields, covering approximately 63 arcmin{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. For typical exposure times ({\textasciitilde}6400 s in G {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}102{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and {\textasciitilde}2700 s in G {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}141{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}), we reach 5σ detection limits for emission lines of f {\textasciitilde} 5 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-17{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} for compact objects. Typical direct imaging 5σ limits are 26.3 and 26.1 mag. ({AB}) in F110W and F140W, respectively. Restricting ourselves to the lines measured with the highest confidence, we present a list of 328 emission lines, in 229 objects, in a redshift range 0.3 \&lt; z \&lt; 3. The single-line emitters are likely to be a mix of Hα and [O {III}]5007,4959 Å, with Hα predominating. The overall surface density of high-confidence emission-line objects in our sample is approximately 4 per arcmin{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. These first fields show high equivalent width sources, active galactic nucleus, and post-starburst galaxies. The median observed star formation rate ({SFR}) of our Hα-selected sample is 4 M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} yr{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. At intermediate redshifts, we detect emission lines in galaxies as faint as H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}140{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 25, or M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}R{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \&lt; -19, and are sensitive to {SFRs} down to less than 1 M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} yr{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}.

Altogether we identify 1048 emission line galaxies with observed equivalent widths greater than 40 Å, 467 of which have multiple detected emission lines. We use simulations to correct for significant (\&gt;20\%) incompleteness introduced in part by the non-dithered, non-rotated nature of the grism parallels. The {WISP} survey is sensitive to fainter flux levels ((3-5) × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-17{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}) than the future space near-infrared grism missions aimed at baryonic acoustic oscillation cosmology ((1-4) × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-16{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}), allowing us to probe the fainter emission line galaxies that the shallower future surveys may miss. Cumulative number counts of 0.7 \&lt; z \&lt; 1.5 galaxies reach 10,000 deg{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} above an Hα flux of 2 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-16{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. Hα-emitting galaxies with comparable [O {III}] flux are roughly five times less common than galaxies with just Hα emission at those flux levels. Galaxies with low Hα/[O {III}] ratios are very rare at the brighter fluxes that future near-infrared grism surveys will probe; our survey finds no galaxies with Hα/[O {III}] \&lt; 0.95 that have Hα flux greater than 3 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-16{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} cm{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. Our Hα luminosity function contains a comparable number density of faint line emitters to that found by the Near {IR} Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer near-infrared grism surveys, but significantly fewer (factors of 3-4 less) high-luminosity emitters. We also find that our high-redshift (z = 0.9-1.5) counts are in agreement with the high-redshift (z = 1.47) narrowband Hα survey of {HiZELS} (Sobral et al.), while our lower redshift luminosity function (z = 0.3-0.9) falls slightly below their z = 0.84 result. The evolution in both the Hα luminosity function from z = 0.3-1.5 and the [O {III}] luminosity function from z = 0.7-2.3 is almost entirely in the L {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}sstarf{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} parameter, which steadily increases with redshift over those ranges.},

	abstract = {In order for the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope ({WFIRST}) and other stage {IV} dark energy experiments (e.g., Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, {LSST}; and Euclid) to infer cosmological parameters not limited by systematic errors, accurate redshift measurements are needed. This accuracy can be met by using spectroscopic subsamples to calibrate the photometric redshifts for the full sample. In this work, we find the minimal number of spectra required for the {WFIRST} weak-lensing redshift calibration by employing the Self-Organizing Map ({SOM}) spectroscopic sampling technique. We use galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey ({CANDELS}) to build the {LSST}+{WFIRST} lensing analog sample of ∼36,000 objects and to train the {LSST}+{WFIRST} {SOM}. We find that 26\% of the {WFIRST} lensing sample consists of sources fainter than the Euclid depth in the optical, 91\% of which live in color cells already occupied by brighter galaxies. We demonstrate the similarity between faint and bright galaxies as well as the feasibility of redshift measurements at different brightness levels. Our results suggest that the spectroscopic sample acquired for calibration to the Euclid depth is sufficient for calibrating the majority of the {WFIRST} color space. For the spectroscopic sample to fully represent the synthetic color space of {WFIRST}, we recommend obtaining additional spectroscopy of ∼0.2–1.2k new sources in cells occupied by mostly faint galaxies. We argue that either the small area of the {CANDELS} fields and the small overall sample size or the large photometric errors might be the reason for no/fewer bright galaxies mapped to these cells. Acquiring the spectra of these sources will confirm the above findings and will enable the comprehensive calibration of the {WFIRST} color–redshift relation.},

	abstract = {Current and future weak-lensing surveys will rely on photometrically estimated redshifts of very large numbers of galaxies. In this paper, we address several different aspects of the demanding photo-z performance that will be required for future experiments, such as the proposed {ESA} Euclid mission. It is first shown that the proposed all-sky near-infrared photometry from Euclid, in combination with anticipated ground-based photometry (e.g. {PanStarrs}-2 or {DES}) should yield the required precision in individual photo-z of σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}z{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}(z) \&lt;= 0.05(1 + z) at I{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}{AB}{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \&lt;= 24.5. Simple a priori rejection schemes based on the photometry alone can be tuned to recognize objects with wildly discrepant photo-z and to reduce the outlier fraction to \&lt;=0.25 per cent with only modest loss of otherwise usable objects. Turning to the more challenging problem of determining the mean redshift \&lt; z\&gt; of a set of galaxies to a precision of {\textbar}∆{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}\&lt;z\&gt;{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textbar} \&lt;= 0.002(1 + z) we argue that, for many different reasons, this may be best accomplished by relying on the photo-z themselves rather than on the direct measurement of \&lt; z\&gt; from spectroscopic redshifts of a representative subset of the galaxies, as has usually been envisaged. We present in Appendix A an analysis of the substantial difficulties in the latter approach that arise from the presence of large-scale structure in spectroscopic survey fields. A simple adaptive scheme based on the statistical properties of the photo-z likelihood functions is shown to meet this stringent systematic requirement, although further tests on real data will be required to verify this. We also examine the effect of an imprecise correction for Galactic extinction on the photo-z and the precision with which the Galactic extinction can be determined from the photometric data itself, for galaxies with or without spectroscopic redshifts. We also explore the effects of contamination by fainter overlapping objects in photo-z determination. The overall conclusion of this paper is that the acquisition of photometrically estimated redshifts with the precision required for Euclid, or other similar experiments, will be challenging but possible.},

Fitting the multiple light curves of such objects can deliver measurements of the lensing time delays, which are the difference in arrival times for the separate images. These measurements provide precise tests of lens models or constraints on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters that are independent of the local distance ladder. Over the next decade, accurate time delay measurements will be needed for the tens to hundreds of lensed {SNe} to be found by wide-field time-domain surveys such as {LSST} and {WFIRST}. We have developed an open-source software package for simulations and time delay measurements of multiply imaged {SNe}, including an improved characterization of the uncertainty caused by microlensing. Using this package, we describe simulations that suggest that a before-peak detection of the leading image enables a more accurate and precise time delay measurement (by ∼1 and ∼2 days, respectively), when compared to an after-peak detection. We also conclude that fitting the effects of microlensing without an accurate prior often leads to biases in the time delay measurement and over-fitting to the data, but that employing a Gaussian Process Regression technique is sufficient for determining the uncertainty due to microlensing.},

	abstract = {Ongoing and future imaging surveys represent significant improvements in depth, area, and seeing compared to current data sets. These improvements offer the opportunity to discover up to three orders of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lenses than are currently known. In this work we forecast the number of lenses that will be discoverable in forthcoming surveys and simulate their properties. We generate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}), and Euclid surveys. We verify our model against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, predicting 250 discoverable lenses compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al. The predicted Einstein radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by Sonnenfeld et al. For future surveys we find that, assuming Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches of the {DES}, {LSST}, and Euclid data sets should discover 2400, 120000, and 170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses, respectively. Finders using blue-minus-red (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in {DES} and {LSST}. The uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high-redshift source population, which typically gives fractional errors on the discoverable lens number at the level of tens of percent. We find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens to be detectable approximately halves the number of detectable lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of understanding the selection function and the sensitivity of future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes publicly available so that the selection function of strong lens finders can easily be calibrated.},

	shorttitle = {{DASH}},
	abstract = {We present {\textbackslash}texttt\{{DASH}\} (Deep Automated Supernova and Host classifier), a novel software package that automates the classification of the type, age, redshift, and host galaxy of supernova spectra. {\textbackslash}texttt\{{DASH}\} makes use of a new approach which does not rely on iterative template matching techniques like all previous software, but instead classifies based on the learned features of each supernova type and age bin. It has achieved this by employing a deep convolutional neural network to train a matching algorithm. This approach has enabled {\textbackslash}texttt\{{DASH}\} to be orders of magnitude faster than previous tools, being able to accurately classify hundreds or thousands of objects within seconds. We have tested its performance on the last four years of data from the ongoing Australian Dark Energy Survey ({OzDES}). The deep learning models were developed using {\textbackslash}texttt\{{TensorFlow}\}, and were trained using over 4000 supernova templates taken from the {CfA} Supernova Program and the Berkeley {SN} Ia Program as used in {\textbackslash}texttt\{{SNID}\} (Supernova Identification software, Blondin \&amp; Tonry (2007)). The trained models are independent of the number of templates, which allows for {\textbackslash}texttt\{{DASH}\}'s unprecedented speed. We have developed both a graphical interface for easy visual classification and analysis of supernovae, and a {\textbackslash}texttt\{Python\} library for the autonomous and quick classification of several supernova spectra. The speed, accuracy, user-friendliness, and versatility of {\textbackslash}texttt\{{DASH}\} presents an advancement to existing spectral classification tools. We have made the code publicly available on {\textbackslash}texttt\{{GitHub}\} and {PyPI} ({\textbackslash}texttt\{pip install astrodash\}) to allow for further contributions and development. The package documentation is available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://astrodash.readthedocs.io\}.},

	abstract = {We present updated constraints on the free-streaming nature of cosmological neutrinos from cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) temperature and polarization power spectra, baryonic acoustic oscillation data, and distance ladder measurements of the Hubble constant. Specifically, we consider a Fermi-like four-fermion interaction between massless neutrinos, characterized by an effective coupling constant G{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, and resulting in a neutrino opacity dot tau{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}νpropto{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} G{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} T{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ν{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}5{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. Using a conservative flat prior on the parameter log{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}( G{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} {MeV}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}), we find a bimodal posterior distribution with two clearly separated regions of high probability. The first of these modes is consistent with the standard Λ{CDM} cosmology and corresponds to neutrinos decoupling at redshift z{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ν,dec{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \&gt; 1.3×10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}5{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, that is before the Fourier modes probed by the {CMB} damping tail enter the causal horizon. The other mode of the posterior, dubbed the "interacting neutrino mode", corresponds to neutrino decoupling occurring within a narrow redshift window centered around z{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ν,dec{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}8300. This mode is characterized by a high value of the effective neutrino coupling constant, log{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}( G{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} {MeV}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}) = -1.72 ± 0.10 (68\% C.L.), together with a lower value of the scalar spectral index and amplitude of fluctuations, and a higher value of the Hubble parameter. Using both a maximum likelihood analysis and the ratio of the two mode's Bayesian evidence, we find the interacting neutrino mode to be statistically disfavored compared to the standard Λ{CDM} cosmology, and determine this result to be largely driven by the low-l {CMB} temperature data. Interestingly, the addition of {CMB} polarization and direct Hubble constant measurements significantly raises the statistical significance of this secondary mode, indicating that new physics in the neutrino sector could help explain the difference between local measurements of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, and those inferred from {CMB} data. A robust consequence of our results is that neutrinos must be free streaming long before the epoch of matter-radiation equality in order to fit current cosmological data.},

The sum of these surveys has the potential to be significantly greater than the contributions of the individual parts. As is detailed in this report, the combination of these surveys should give us multi-wavelength high-resolution images of galaxies and broadband data covering much of the stellar energy spectrum. These stellar and galactic data have the potential of yielding new insights into topics ranging from the formation history of the Milky Way to the mass of the neutrino. However, enabling the astronomy community to fully exploit this multi-instrument data set is a challenging technical task: for much of the science, we will need to combine the photometry across multiple wavelengths with varying spectral and spatial resolution.

	abstract = {The six parameters of the standard Λ{CDM} model have best-fit values derived from the Planck temperature power spectrum that are shifted somewhat from the best-fit values derived from {WMAP} data. These shifts are driven by features in the Planck temperature power spectrum at angular scales that had never before been measured to cosmic-variance level precision. We have investigated these shifts to determine whether they are within the range of expectation and to understand their origin in the data. Taking our parameter set to be the optical depth of the reionized intergalactic medium τ, the baryon density ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, the matter density ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, the angular size of the sound horizon θ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum, n{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, and A{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}- 2τ{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} (where A{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} is the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum), we have examined the change in best-fit values between a {WMAP}-like large angular-scale data set (with multipole moment ℓ \&lt; 800 in the Planck temperature power spectrum) and an all angular-scale data set (ℓ \&lt; 2500Planck temperature power spectrum), each with a prior on τ of 0.07 ± 0.02. We find that the shifts, in units of the 1σ expected dispersion for each parameter, are \{ ∆τ,∆A{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}- 2τ{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater},∆n{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater},∆ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater},∆ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater},∆θ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} \} = \{ -1.7,-2.2,1.2,-2.0,1.1,0.9 \}, with a χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} value of 8.0. We find that this χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} value is exceeded in 15\% of our simulated data sets, and that a parameter deviates by more than 2.2σ in 9\% of simulated data sets, meaning that the shifts are not unusually large. Comparing ℓ \&lt; 800 instead to ℓ\&gt; 800, or splitting at a different multipole, yields similar results. We examined the ℓ \&lt; 800 model residuals in the ℓ\&gt; 800 power spectrum data and find that the features there that drive these shifts are a set of oscillations across a broad range of angular scales. Although they partly appear similar to the effects of enhanced gravitational lensing, the shifts in Λ{CDM} parameters that arise in response to these features correspond to model spectrum changes that are predominantly due to non-lensing effects; the only exception is τ, which, at fixed A{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}e{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}- 2τ{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, affects the ℓ\&gt; 800 temperature power spectrum solely through the associated change in A{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and the impact of that on the lensing potential power spectrum. We also ask, "what is it about the power spectrum at ℓ \&lt; 800 that leads to somewhat different best-fit parameters than come from the full ℓ range?" We find that if we discard the data at ℓ \&lt; 30, where there is a roughly 2σ downward fluctuation in power relative to the model that best fits the full ℓ range, the ℓ \&lt; 800 best-fit parameters shift significantly towards the ℓ \&lt; 2500 best-fit parameters. In contrast, including ℓ \&lt; 30, this previously noted "low-ℓ deficit" drives n{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} up and impacts parameters correlated with n{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, such as ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} and H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. As expected, the ℓ \&lt; 30 data have a much greater impact on the ℓ \&lt; 800 best fit than on the ℓ \&lt; 2500 best fit. So although the shifts are not very significant, we find that they can be understood through the combined effects of an oscillatory-like set of high-ℓ residuals and the deficit in low-ℓ power, excursions consistent with sample variance that happen to map onto changes in cosmological parameters. Finally, we examine agreement between {PlanckTT} data and two other {CMB} data sets, namely the Planck lensing reconstruction and the {TT} power spectrum measured by the South Pole Telescope, again finding a lack of convincing evidence of any significant deviations in parameters, suggesting that current {CMB} data sets give an internally consistent picture of the Λ{CDM} model.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180706209P/abstract},
	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the {CMB} anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model. Combining with {BAO} we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu\&lt; 0.12\${eV}. The {CMB} spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) {BAO} data.

To perform the analysis, we employ the current cosmological observations, including the cosmic microwave background temperature power spectrum data from the Planck mission, the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, the type Ia supernova data, the redshift space distortion measurements, the shear data of weak lensing observation, the Planck lensing measurement, and the latest direct measurement of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} as well. We show that, compared to the Λ {CDM} cosmology, the holographic dark energy cosmology with sterile neutrinos can relieve the tension between the Planck observation and the direct measurement of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} much better. Once we include the H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurement in the global fit, we find that the hint of the existence of sterile neutrinos in the holographic dark energy cosmology can be given. Under the constraint of the all-data combination, we obtain N{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=3.76 ±0.26 and m{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ν{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater},sterile eff{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}\&lt;0.215 {eV} , indicating that the detection of ∆ N{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\&gt;0 in the holographic dark energy cosmology is at the 2.75 σ level and the massless or very light sterile neutrino is favored by the current observations.},

Here we perform a combined analysis of the Planck and R16 results in an extended parameter space, varying simultaneously 12 cosmological parameters instead of the usual 6. We find that a phantom-like dark energy component, with effective equation of state w = -1.29{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.12{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.15{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} at 68\% c.l. can solve the current tension between the Planck dataset and the R16 prior in an extended Λ{CDM} scenario. On the other hand, the neutrino effective number is fully compatible with standard expectations. This result is confirmed when including cosmic shear data from the {CFHTLenS} survey and {CMB} lensing constraints from Planck. However, when {BAO} measurements are included we find that some of the tension with R16 remains, as also is the case when we include the supernova type Ia luminosity distances from the {JLA} catalog.},

	abstract = {The tension between the best fit parameters derived by the Planck team and a number of other astronomical measurements suggests either systematics in the astronomical measurements, systematics in the Planck data, the need for new physics, or a combination thereof. We reanalyze the Planck data and find that the 217 {GHz} ×217 {GHz} detector set spectrum used in the Planck analysis is responsible for some of this tension. We use a map-based foreground cleaning procedure, relying on a combination of 353 {GHz} and 545 {GHz} maps to reduce residual foregrounds in the intermediate frequency maps used for cosmological inference. For our baseline data analysis, which uses 47\% of the sky and makes use of both 353 and 545 {GHz} data for foreground cleaning, we find the Λ {CDM} cosmological parameters Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}c{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}h{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}=0.1170 ±0.0025 , n{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.9686 ±0.0069 , H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=68.0 ±1.1 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} , Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}b{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}h{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}=0.02197 ±0.00026 , ln 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}A{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=3.082 ±0.025 , and τ =0.090 ±0.013 . While in broad agreement with the results reported by the Planck team, these revised parameters imply a universe with a lower matter density of Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.302 ±0.015 , and parameter values generally more consistent with pre-Planck {CMB} analyses and astronomical observations. We compare our cleaning procedure with the foreground modeling used by the Planck team and find good agreement. The difference in parameters between our analysis and that of the Planck team is mostly due to our use of cross-spectra from the publicly available survey maps instead of their use of the detector set cross-spectra which include pixels only observed in one of the surveys. We show evidence suggesting residual systematics in the detector set spectra used in the Planck likelihood code, which is substantially reduced for our spectra. Using our cleaned survey cross-spectra, we recompute the limit on neutrino species and find N{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=3.34 ±0.35 . We also recompute limits on the n{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}s{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}-r plane, and neutrino mass constraints.},

	abstract = {I reanalyse the Riess et al. (hereafter R11) Cepheid data using the revised geometric maser distance to {NGC} 4258 of Humphreys et al. (hereafter H13). I explore different outlier rejection criteria designed to give a reduced χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} of unity and compare the results with the R11 rejection algorithm, which produces a reduced χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} that is substantially less than unity and, in some cases, leads to underestimates of the errors on parameters. I show that there are sub-luminous low-metallicity Cepheids in the R11 sample that skew the global fits of the period-luminosity relation. This has a small but non-negligible impact on the global fits using {NGC} 4258 as a distance scale anchor, but adds a poorly constrained source of systematic error when using the Large Magellanic Cloud as an anchor. I also show that the small Milky Way Cepheid sample with accurate parallax measurements leads to a distance to {NGC} 4258 that is in tension with the maser distance. I conclude that H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} based on the {NGC} 4258 maser distance is H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 70.6 ± 3.3 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, compatible within 1σ with the recent determination from Planck for the base six-parameter Λ cold dark matter cosmology. If the H-band period-luminosity relation is assumed to be independent of metallicity and the three distance anchors are combined, I find H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 72.5 ± 2.5 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, which differs by 1.9σ from the Planck value. The differences between the Planck results and these estimates of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} are not large enough to provide compelling evidence for new physics at this stage.},

	abstract = {We present a refined gravitational lens model of the four-image lens system B1608+656 based on new and improved observational constraints: (1) the three independent time delays and flux ratios from Very Large Array observations, (2) the radio-image positions from Very Large Baseline Array observations, (3) the shape of the deconvolved Einstein ring from optical and infrared Hubble Space Telescope images, (4) the extinction-corrected lens-galaxy centroids and structural parameters, and (5) a stellar velocity dispersion, σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}ap{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=247+/-35 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, of the primary lens galaxy (G1), obtained from an echelle spectrum taken with the Keck {II} Telescope. The lens-mass model consists of two elliptical mass distributions with power-law density profiles and an external shear, totaling 22 free parameters, including the density slopes that are the key parameters for determining the value of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} from lens time delays. This has required the development of a new lens code that is highly optimized for speed. The minimum-χ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}2{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} model reproduces all observations very well, including the stellar velocity dispersion and the shape of the Einstein ring. A combined gravitational lens and stellar dynamical analysis leads to a value of the Hubble constant of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=75{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+7{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}- 1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater} -1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} (68\% {CL}; Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}m{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.3, Ω{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}Λ{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=0.7). The nonlinear error analysis includes correlations between all free parameters, in particular the density slopes of G1 and G2, yielding an accurate determination of the random error on H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}. The lens galaxy G1 is {\textasciitilde}5 times more massive than the secondary lens galaxy (G2) and has a mass density slope of γ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}'{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}G1{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=2.03{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}+0.14{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}-0.14{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}+/-0.03 (68\% {CL}) for ρ{\textasciitilde}r{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-γ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}'{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, very close to isothermal (γ{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}'{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}=2). After extinction correction, G1 exhibits a smooth surface brightness distribution with an R{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}1/4{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} profile and no apparent evidence for tidal disruption by interactions with G2. Given the scope of the observational constraints and the gravitational lens models, as well as the careful corrections to the data, we believe this value of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to be little affected by known systematic errors (\&lt;{\textasciitilde}5\%).

We investigate to what degree the so-called fast-declining {SNe} Ia can be used to determine accurate extragalactic distances. We estimate the intrinsic scatter in the luminosity-decline rate relation and find it ranges from ±0.13 mag to ±0.18 mag with no obvious dependence on wavelength. Using the Cepheid variable star data from the {SH}0ES project, the {SN} Ia distance scale is calibrated and the Hubble constant is estimated using our optical and near-infrared sample, and these results are compared to those determined exclusively from a near-infrared subsample. The systematic effect of the supernova’s host galaxy mass is investigated as a function of wavelength and is found to decrease toward redder wavelengths, suggesting this effect may be due to dust properties of the host. Using estimates of the dust extinction derived from optical and near-infrared wavelengths and applying these to the H band, we derive a Hubble constant \{H\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=73.2+/-2.3 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} \{Mpc\}\}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, whereas using a simple B - V color correction applied to the B band yields \{H\}{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}=72.7+/-2.1 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} \{Mpc\}\}{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {The most precise local measurements of H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} rely on observations of Type Ia supernovae ({SNe} Ia) coupled with Cepheid distances to {SN} Ia host galaxies. Recent results have shown tension comparing H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} to the value inferred from {CMB} observations assuming Λ{CDM}, making it important to check for potential systematic uncertainties in either approach. To date, precise local H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} measurements have used {SN} Ia distances based on optical photometry, with corrections for light curve shape and colour. Here, we analyse {SNe} Ia as standard candles in the near-infrared ({NIR}), where luminosity variations in the supernovae and extinction by dust are both reduced relative to the optical. From a combined fit to 9 nearby calibrator {SNe} with host Cepheid distances from Riess et al. (2016) and 27 {SNe} in the Hubble flow, we estimate the absolute peak J magnitude M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}J{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = -18.524 ± 0.041 mag and H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 72.8 ± 1.6 (statistical) ±2.7 (systematic) km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}. The 2.2\% statistical uncertainty demonstrates that the {NIR} provides a compelling avenue to measuring {SN} Ia distances, and for our sample the intrinsic (unmodeled) peak J magnitude scatter is just 0.10 mag, even without light curve shape or colour corrections. Our results do not vary significantly with different sample selection criteria, though photometric calibration in the {NIR} may be a dominant systematic uncertainty. Our findings suggest that tension in the competing H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} distance ladders is likely not a result of supernova systematics that could be expected to vary between optical and {NIR} wavelengths, like dust extinction. We anticipate further improvements in H{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} with a larger calibrator sample of {SNe} Ia with Cepheid distances, more Hubble flow {SNe} Ia with {NIR} light curves, and better use of the full {NIR} photometric data set beyond simply the peak J-band magnitude.},

Type {II} {SNe} are defined by the presence of hydrogen, and they exhibit a very wide variety of photometric and spectroscopic properties. Among hydrogen-deficient {SNe} (Type I), three subclasses are now known: those whose early-time spectra show strong Si {II} (Ia), prominent He I (Ib), or neither Si {II} nor He I (Ic). The late-time spectra of {SNe} Ia consist of a multitude of blended emission lines of iron-group elements; in sharp contrast, those of {SNe} Ib and {SNe} Ic (which are similar to each other) are dominated by several relatively unblended lines of intermediate-mass elements. Although {SNe} Ia, which result from the thermonuclear runaway of white dwarfs, constitute a rather homogeneous subclass, important variations in their photometric and spectroscopic properties are undeniably present. {SNe} Ib/Ic probably result from core collapse in massive stars largely stripped of their hydrogen (Ib) and helium (Ic) envelopes, and hence they are physically related to {SNe} {II}. Indeed, the progenitors of some {SNe} {II} seem to have only a low-mass skin of hydrogen; their spectra gradually evolve to resemble those of {SNe} Ib. In addition to the two well-known photometric subclasses (linear and plateau) of {SNe} {II}, which may exhibit minor spectroscopic differences, there is a new subclass ({SNe} {IIn}) distinguished by relatively narrow emission lines with little or no P Cygni absorption component and slowly declining light curves.

We develop a diagnostic to quantify the quality of a correlation between the input and template spectra, which enables a formal evaluation of the associated redshift error. Furthermore, by comparing the correlation redshifts obtained using {SNID} with those determined from narrow lines in the {SN} host galaxy spectrum, we show that accurate redshifts (with a typical error σ{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}z{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textasciitilde}0.01) can be determined for {SNe} Ia without a spectrum of the host galaxy.

	abstract = {In the upcoming synoptic all-sky survey era of astronomy, thousands of new multiply imaged quasars are expected to be discovered and monitored regularly. Light curves from the images of gravitationally lensed quasars are further affected by superimposed variability due to microlensing. In order to disentangle the microlensing from the intrinsic variability of the light curves, the time delays between the multiple images have to be accurately measured. The resulting microlensing light curves can then be analyzed to reveal information about the background source, such as the size of the quasar accretion disk. In this paper we present the most extensive and coherent collection of simulated microlensing light curves; we have generated {\textbackslash}gt 2.5 billion light curves using the {GERLUMPH} high resolution microlensing magnification maps. Our simulations can be used to train algorithms to measure lensed quasar time delays, plan future monitoring campaigns, and study light curve properties throughout parameter space.

We present here the {GERLUMPH} Data Release 1, which consists of 12,342 high resolution cosmological microlensing magnification maps and provides the first uniform coverage of the convergence, shear, and smooth matter fraction parameter space. We use these maps to perform a comprehensive numerical investigation of the mass-sheet degeneracy, finding excellent agreement with its predictions. We study the effect of smooth matter on microlensing induced magnification fluctuations. In particular, in the minima and saddle-point regions, fluctuations are enhanced only along the critical line, while in the maxima region they are always enhanced for high smooth matter fractions (≈0.9). We describe our approach to data management, including the use of an {SQL} database with a Web interface for data access and online analysis, obviating the need for individuals to download large volumes of data. In combination with existing observational databases and online applications, the {GERLUMPH} archive represents a fundamental component of a new microlensing {eResearch} cloud.

Both being potential hosts of astrophysical sources of gravitational waves, {GLADE} includes inactive and active galaxies as well. {GLADE} was constructed by cross-matching and combining data from five separate (but not independent) astronomical catalogues: {GWGC}, 2MPZ, 2MASS {XSC}, {HyperLEDA}, and {SDSS}-{DR}12Q. {GLADE} is complete up to d\_L=37{\textasciicircum}\{+3\}\_\{-4\} Mpc in terms of the cumulative B-band luminosity of galaxies within luminosity distance d{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}L{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}, and contains all of the brightest galaxies giving half of the total B-band luminosity up to d\_L=91 Mpc.

	abstract = {Cosmology is one of the four science pillars of {LSST}, which promises to be transformative for our understanding of dark energy and dark matter. The {LSST} Dark Energy Science Collaboration ({DESC}) has been tasked with deriving constraints on cosmological parameters from {LSST} data. Each of the cosmological probes for {LSST} is heavily impacted by the choice of observing strategy. This white paper is written by the {LSST} {DESC} Observing Strategy Task Force ({OSTF}), which represents the entire collaboration, and aims to make recommendations on observing strategy that will benefit all cosmological analyses with {LSST}. It is accompanied by the {DESC} {DDF} (Deep Drilling Fields) white paper (Scolnic et al.). We use a variety of metrics to understand the effects of the observing strategy on measurements of weak lensing, large-scale structure, clusters, photometric redshifts, supernovae, strong lensing and kilonovae. In order to reduce systematic uncertainties, we conclude that the current baseline observing strategy needs to be significantly modified to result in the best possible cosmological constraints. We provide some key recommendations: moving the {WFD} (Wide-Fast-Deep) footprint to avoid regions of high extinction, taking visit pairs in different filters, changing the 2x15s snaps to a single exposure to improve efficiency, focusing on strategies that reduce long gaps (\&gt;15 days) between observations, and prioritizing spatial uniformity at several intervals during the 10-year survey.},

	abstract = {We present the Pan-{STARRS}1 discovery of {PS}1-10afx, a unique hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova ({SLSN}) at redshift z = 1.388. The light curve peaked at z {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}P1{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 21.7 mag, making {PS}1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known {SNe}, with M{\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}u{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and near-infrared observations indicate that the bolometric light curve of {PS}1-10afx rose on the unusually fast timescale of {\textasciitilde}12 days to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}44{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} (M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}bol{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the spectral energy distribution is unusually red for an {SLSN}, with a color temperature of {\textasciitilde}6800 K near maximum light, in contrast to previous hydrogen-poor {SLSNe}, which are bright in the ultraviolet ({UV}). The spectra more closely resemble those of a normal {SN} Ic than any known {SLSN}, with a photospheric velocity of {\textasciitilde}11, 000 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} and evidence for line blanketing in the rest-frame {UV}. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large emitting radius (gsim 5 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}15{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (1) a nickel-powered light curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast timescale; (2) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (3) models invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the observed spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in pre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of {\textasciitilde}15 M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} yr{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater}, and is fairly massive ({\textasciitilde}2 × 10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}10{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} M {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater}), with a stellar population age of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}8{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} yr, also in contrast to the young dwarf hosts of known hydrogen-poor {SLSNe}. {PS}1-10afx is distinct from known examples of {SLSNe} in its spectra, colors, light-curve shape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a different channel than other hydrogen-poor {SLSNe}.},

These bright Cepheids were observed with the {WFC}3 spatial scanning mode in the optical and near-infrared to mitigate saturation and reduce pixel-to-pixel calibration errors to reach a mean photometric error of 5 mmag per observation. We use the new Gaia {DR}2 parallaxes and {HST} photometry to simultaneously constrain the cosmic distance scale and to measure the {DR}2 parallax zeropoint offset appropriate for Cepheids. We find the latter to be -46 ± 13 μas or ±6 μas for a fixed distance scale, higher than found from quasars, as expected for these brighter and redder sources. The precision of the distance scale from {DR}2 has been reduced by a factor of 2.5 because of the need to independently determine the parallax offset. The best-fit distance scale is 1.006 ± 0.033, relative to the scale from Riess et al. with H {\textless}{SUB}{\textgreater}0{\textless}/{SUB}{\textgreater} = 73.24 km s{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} Mpc{\textless}{SUP}{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/{SUP}{\textgreater} used to predict the parallaxes photometrically, and is inconsistent with the scale needed to match the Planck 2016 cosmic microwave background data combined with Λ{CDM} at the 2.9σ confidence level (99.6\%). At 96.5\% confidence we find that the formal {DR}2 errors may be underestimated as indicated. We identify additional errors associated with the use of augmented Cepheid samples utilizing ground-based photometry and discuss their likely origins. Including the {DR}2 parallaxes with all prior distance-ladder data raises the current tension between the late and early universe route to the Hubble constant to 3.8σ (99.99\%).

	shorttitle = {Time-delay cosmography},
	abstract = {Strong lensing time-delay systems constrain cosmological parameters via the so-called time-delay distance and the angular diameter distance to the lens. In previous studies, only the former information was used in forecasting cosmographic constraints. In this paper, we show that the cosmological constraints improve significantly when the latter information is also included. Specifically, the angular diameter distance plays a crucial role in breaking the degeneracy between the curvature of the Universe and the time-varying equation of state of dark energy. Using a mock sample of 55 bright quadruple lens systems based on expectations for ongoing/future imaging surveys, we find that adding the angular diameter distance information to the time-delay distance information and the Planck's measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies improves the constraint on the constant equation of state by 30\%, on the time variation in the equation of state by a factor of two, and on the Hubble constant in the flat Λ{CDM} model by a factor of two. Therefore, previous forecasts for the statistical power of time-delay systems were overly pessimistic, i.e., time-delay systems are more powerful than previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {Beyond Ultra-deep Frontier Fields And Legacy Observations ({BUFFALO}) is
an astronomical survey built around the six Hubble Space Telescope ({HST})
Frontier Fields clusters designed to learn about early galactic assembly
and clustering and prepare targets for observations with the James Webb
Space Telescope. {BUFFALO} will place significant new constraints on how
and when the most massive and luminous galaxies in the universe formed
and how early galaxy formation is linked to dark matter assembly. The
same data will also probe the temperature and cross section of dark
matter in the massive Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, and tell us how
the dark matter, cluster gas, and dynamics of the clusters influence the
galaxies in and around them. These studies are possible because the
Spitzer Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory, {XMM}-Newton, and
ground based telescopes have already invested heavily in deep
observations around the Frontier Fields, so that the addition of {HST}
observations can yield significant new results.},

	abstract = {The Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey ({RELICS}) Hubble Treasury Program
has completed observations of 41 massive galaxy clusters with 188 orbits
of {HST} {ACS} and {WFC}3/{IR} imaging and 390 hours of Spitzer {IRAC} imaging.
This poster presents an overview of the program and data releases.
Reduced images, catalogs, and lens models for all clusters are now
available on {MAST}. {RELICS} is studying the clusters, supernovae, and
lensed high-redshift galaxies. A companion poster presents our high-
redshift results: over 300 lensed z {\textasciitilde} 6 - 10 candidates, including some
of the brightest known at these redshifts (Salmon et al. 2018). These
will be excellent targets for detailed follow-up study in {JWST} Cycle 1
{GO} proposals.},
