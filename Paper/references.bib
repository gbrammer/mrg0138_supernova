	abstract = {The Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) was a multi-cycle treasury program on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that surveyed a total area of ∼0.25 deg2 with ∼900 HST orbits spread across ﬁve ﬁelds over three years. Within these survey images we discovered 65 supernovae (SNe) of all types, out to z ∼ 2.5. We classify ∼24 of these as Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) based on host galaxy redshifts and SN photometry (supplemented by grism spectroscopy of six SNe). Here we present a measurement of the volumetric SN Ia rate as a function of redshift, reaching for the ﬁrst time beyond z = 2 and putting new constraints on SN Ia progenitor models. Our highest redshift bin includes detections of SNe that exploded when the universe was only ∼3 Gyr old and near the peak of the cosmic star formation history. This gives the CANDELS high redshift sample unique leverage for evaluating the fraction of SNe Ia that explode promptly after formation ({\textless}500 Myr). Combining the CANDELS rates with all available SN Ia rate measurements in the literature we ﬁnd that this prompt SN Ia fraction is fP = 0.53sta±t00..1009sy±s00..2160, consistent with a delay time distribution that follows a simple t−1 power law for all times t {\textgreater} 40 Myr. However, mild tension is apparent between ground-based low-z surveys and space-based high-z surveys. In both CANDELS and the sister HST program CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova Survey with Hubble), we ﬁnd a low rate of SNe Ia at z {\textgreater} 1. This could be a hint that prompt progenitors are in fact relatively rare, accounting for only 20\% of all SN Ia explosions—though further analysis and larger samples will be needed to examine that suggestion.},

	abstract = {We report results from the Supernova Photometric Classification Challenge (SNPhotCC), a publicly released mix of simulated supernovae (SNe), with types (Ia, Ibc, and II) selected in proportion to their expected rates. The simulation was realized in the griz filters of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) with realistic observing conditions (sky noise, point-spread function, and atmospheric transparency) based on years of recorded conditions at the DES site. Simulations of non–Ia-type SNe are based on spectroscopically confirmed light curves that include unpublished non-Ia samples donated from the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP), the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II). A spectroscopically confirmed subset was provided for training. We challenged scientists to run their classification algorithms and report a type and photo-z for each SN. Participants from 10 groups contributed 13 entries for the sample that included a host-galaxy photo-z for each SN and nine entries for the sample that had no redshift information. Several different classification strategies resulted in similar performance, and for all entries the performance was significantly better for the training subset than for the unconfirmed sample. For the spectroscopically unconfirmed subset, the entry with the highest average figure of merit for classifying SNe Ia has an efficiency of 0.96 and an SN Ia purity of 0.79. As a public resource for the future development of photometric SN classification and photo-z estimators, we have released updated simulations with improvements based on our experience from the SNPhotCC, added samples corresponding to the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the SDSS-II, and provided the answer keys so that developers can evaluate their own analysis.},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ∼N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

	abstract = {The upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will detect many strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) for timedelay cosmography. This will provide an independent and direct way for measuring the Hubble constant H0, which is necessary to address the current 4.4σ tension in H0 between the local distance ladder and the early Universe measurements. We present a detailed analysis of diﬀerent observing strategies (also referred to as cadence strategy) for the LSST, and quantify their impact on time-delay measurement between multiple images of LSNe Ia. For this, we simulated observations by using mock LSNe Ia for which we produced mock-LSST light curves that account for microlensing. Furthermore, we used the free-knot splines estimator from the software PyCS to measure the time delay from the simulated observations. We ﬁnd that using only LSST data for time-delay cosmography is not ideal. Instead, we advocate using LSST as a discovery machine for LSNe Ia, enabling time delay measurements from follow-up observations from other instruments in order to increase the number of systems by a factor of 2–16 depending on the observing strategy. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that LSST observing strategies, which provide a good sampling frequency (the mean internight gap is around two days) and high cumulative season length (ten seasons with a season length of around 170 days per season), are favored. Rolling cadences subdivide the survey and focus on diﬀerent parts in diﬀerent years; these observing strategies trade the number of seasons for better sampling frequency. In our investigation, this leads to half the number of systems in comparison to the best observing strategy. Therefore rolling cadences are disfavored because the gain from the increased sampling frequency cannot compensate for the shortened cumulative season length. We anticipate that the sample of lensed SNe Ia from our preferred LSST cadence strategies with rapid follow-up observations would yield an independent percent-level constraint on H0.},

Multiband photometry of the resolved images provides unique information about the differential dimming due to dust in the lensing galaxy. Using HST and Keck AO reference images taken after the SN faded, we obtain a total lensing magniﬁcation for iPTF16geu of μ = 67.8+−22..69, accounting for extinction in the host and lensing galaxy. As expected from the symmetry of the system, we measure very short time-delays for the three fainter images with respect to the brightest one: −0.23 ± 0.99, −1.43 ± 0.74, and 1.36 ± 1.07 d. Interestingly, we ﬁnd large differences between the magniﬁcations of the four supernova images, even after accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections: m1 = −3.88+−00..0076, m2 = −2.99+−00..0098, m3 = −2.19+−00..1145, and m4 = −2.40+−00..1142 mag, discrepant with model predictions suggesting similar image brightnesses. A possible explanation for the large differences is gravitational lensing by substructures, micro- or millilensing, in addition to the large-scale lens causing the image separations. We ﬁnd that the inferred magniﬁcation is insensitive to the assumptions about the dust properties in the host and lens galaxy.},

	abstract = {Stellar kinematics provide insights into the masses and formation histories of galaxies. At high redshifts, spatially resolving the stellar kinematics of quiescent galaxies is challenging due to their compact sizes. Using deep nearinfrared spectroscopy, we have measured the resolved stellar kinematics of four quiescent galaxies at z=1.95–2.64, introduced in PaperI, that are gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters. Analyses of two of these have previously been reported individually by Newman et al.and Toft et al., and for the latter, we present new observations. All four galaxies show signiﬁcant rotation and can be classiﬁed as “fast rotators.” In the three systems for which the lensing constraints permit a reconstruction of the source, we ﬁnd that all are likely to be highly ﬂattened (intrinsic ellipticities of ≈0.75–0.85) disk-dominated galaxies with rapid rotation speeds of Vmax=290–352kms−1 and predominantly rotational support, as indicated by the ratio (V s)Re = 1.7–2.3. Compared to coeval star-forming galaxies of similar mass, the quiescent galaxies have smaller V/σ. Given their high masses, Mdyn  2 ´ 1011 M, we argue that these galaxies are likely to evolve into “slow rotator” elliptical galaxies whose speciﬁc angular momentum is reduced by a factor of 5–10. This provides strong evidence for merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies after quenching. Consistent with indirect evidence from earlier morphological studies, our small but unique sample suggests that the kinematic transformations that produced round, dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies were not generally coincident with quenching. Such galaxies probably emerged later via mergers that increased their masses and sizes while also eroding their rotational support.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the advantages of observing at near-IR wavelengths, we investigate Type II supernovae (SNe II) as distance indicators at those wavelengths through the Photospheric Magnitude Method (PMM). For the analysis, we use BVIJH photometry and optical spectroscopy of 24 SNe II during the photospheric phase. To correct photometry for extinction and redshift effects, we compute total-to-selective broad-band extinction ratios and K-corrections up to z = 0.032. To estimate host galaxy colour excesses, we use the colour–colour curve method with the V–I versus B–V as colour combination. We calibrate the PMM using four SNe II in galaxies having Tip of the Red Giant Branch distances. Among our 24 SNe II, nine are at cz {\textgreater} 2000 km s−1, which we use to construct Hubble diagrams (HDs). To further explore the PMM distance precision, we include into HDs the four SNe used for calibration and other two in galaxies with Cepheid and SN Ia distances. With a set of 15 SNe II we obtain an HD rms of 0.13 mag for the J-band, which compares to the rms of 0.15–0.26 mag for optical bands. This reﬂects the beneﬁts of measuring PMM distances with near-IR instead of optical photometry. With the evidence we have, we can set the PMM distance precision with J-band below 10 per cent with a conﬁdence level of 99 per cent.},

We calibrate this standardization using SNe II with host galaxy distances measured using Cepheids, and a well-constrained shock breakout epoch and extinction due to the host galaxy. We estimate the reddening with an analysis of the B −V versus V −I color–color curves, similar to that of Natali et al. With four SNe II meeting the above requirements, we build a photospheric magnitude versus color diagram (similar to an H-R diagram) with a dispersion of 0.29 mag. We also show that when using time since shock breakout instead of color as the independent variable, the same standardization gives a dispersion of 0.09 mag. Moreover, we show that the above time-based standardization corresponds to the generalization of the standardized candle method of Hamuy \& Pinto for various epochs throughout the photospheric phase. To test the new tool, we construct Hubble diagrams for different subsamples of 50 low-redshift (cz {\textless} 104 km s−1) SNe II. For 13 SNe within the Hubble ﬂow (czCMB {\textgreater} 3000 km s−1) and with a well-constrained shock breakout epoch we obtain values of 68–69 km s−1 Mpc−1 for the Hubble constant and a mean intrinsic scatter of 0.12 mag or 6\% in relative distances.},

	abstract = {Based on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the Type II-Plateau SN 2013eq, we present a comparative study of commonly used distance determination methods based on Type II supernovae. The occurrence of SN 2013eq in the Hubble ﬂow (z = 0.041 ± 0.001) prompted us to investigate the implications of the diﬀerence between “angular” and “luminosity” distances within the framework of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) that relies upon a relation between ﬂux and angular size to yield a distance. Following a re-derivation of the basic equations of the EPM for SNe at non-negligible redshifts, we conclude that the EPM results in an angular distance. The observed ﬂux should be converted into the SN rest frame and the angular size, θ, has to be corrected by a factor of (1 + z)2. Alternatively, the EPM angular distance can be converted to a luminosity distance by implementing a modiﬁcation of the angular size. For SN 2013eq, we ﬁnd EPM luminosity distances of DL = 151 ± 18 Mpc and DL = 164 ± 20 Mpc by making use of diﬀerent sets of dilution factors taken from the literature. Application of the standardized candle method for Type II-P SNe results in an independent luminosity distance estimate (DL = 168 ± 16 Mpc) that is consistent with the EPM estimate.},

These data show SN 1992am to be type II-P, displaying hydrogen in its spectrum and the typical shoulder in its light curve. The photometric data and the distance from our own analysis are used to construct the supernova’s bolometric light curve. Using the bolometric light curve, we estimate SN 1992am ejected approximately 0.30. i\#o °f 56Ni, an amount four times larger than that of other well studied SNe II. SN 1992amis; host galaxy lies at a redshift of cz = 14 600 km s-1, making it one of the most distant SNe II discovered, and an important application of the Expanding Photosphere Method. Since z=0.05 is large enough for redshift-dependent effects to matter, we develop the technique to derive luminosity distances with the Expanding Photosphere Method at any redshift, and apply this method to SN 1992am. The derived distance, D=180Í25 Mpc, is independent of all other rungs in the extragalactic distance ladder. The redshift of SN Jl992am’s host galaxy is sufficiently large that uncertainties due to perturbations in the smooth Hubble flo{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum} should be smaller than 10\%. The Hubble ratio derived from the distance and redshift of this single object is H0=Slt{\textbackslash}l km s-1 Mpc-1. In the future, with more of these distant objects, we hope to establish an independent and statistically robust estimate of H0 based solely on type II supernovae.},

	abstract = {Type II-plateau supernovae (SNe II-P) are the classic variety of core-collapse events that result from isolated, massive stars with thick hydrogen envelopes intact at the time of explosion. Their distances are now routinely estimated through two techniques: the expanding photosphere method (EPM), a primary distance-determining method, and the recently developed standard-candle method (SCM), a promising secondary technique. Using Cycle 10 Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we identify 41 Cepheid variable stars in NGC 1637, the host galaxy of the most thoroughly studied SN II-P to date, SN 1999em. Remarkably, the Cepheid distance that we derive to NGC 1637, D ¼ 11:7 Æ 1:0 Mpc, is nearly 50\% larger than earlier EPM distance estimates to SN 1999em. This is the ﬁrst direct comparison between these two primary distance-determining methods for a galaxy hosting a well-observed, spectroscopically and photometrically normal, SN II-P. Extensive consistency checks show strong evidence to support the Cepheid distance scale, so we are led to believe either that SN 1999em is in some heretofore unsuspected way an unusual SN II-P, or that the SN II-P distance scale must be revised. Assuming the latter, this one calibration yields H0ðEPMÞ ¼ 57 Æ 15 km sÀ1 MpcÀ1 and H0ðSCMÞ ¼ 59 Æ 11 km sÀ1 MpcÀ1; additional calibrating galaxies are clearly desirable in order to test the robustness of both determinations of H0. The HST observations of NGC 1637 also captured the fading SN 1999em 2 yr after explosion, providing the latest photometry ever obtained for an SN II-P. The nebularphase photometric behavior of SN 1999em closely follows that observed for SN 1987A at similar epochs. The V and I light curves are both declining at rates signiﬁcantly greater than the decay slope of 56Co predicts. This is likely due to an increasing transparency of the envelope to gamma rays and perhaps also to the formation of dust in the cooling atmosphere of the SN. The absolute V-band brightness of SN 1999em is \$0.25 mag brighter than SN 1987A at the same epochs, which suggests that a slightly greater amount of radioactive 56Ni, \$0.09 M , was ejected by SN 1999em than was derived for SN 1987A (0.075 M ).},

This observed magniﬁcation provides a rare opportunity for a direct empirical test of galaxy cluster lens models. Here we test 17 lens models, 13 of which were generated before the SN magniﬁcation was known, qualifying as pure “blind tests.” The models are collectively fairly accurate: 8 of the models deliver median magniﬁcations that are consistent with the measured μ to within 1σ. However, there is a subtle systematic bias: the signiﬁcant disagreements all involve models overpredicting the magniﬁcation. We evaluate possible causes for this mild bias, and ﬁnd no single physical or methodological explanation to account for it. We do ﬁnd that model accuracy can be improved to some extent with stringent quality cuts on multiply imaged systems, such as requiring that a large fraction have spectroscopic redshifts. In addition to testing model accuracies as we have done here, Type Ia SN magniﬁcations could also be used as inputs for future lens models of Abell 2744 and other clusters, providing valuable constraints in regions where traditional strong- and weak-lensing information is unavailable.},

It is shown that the observable properties of SNe Ia resulting from Chandrasekhar-mass explosions are chieﬂy determined by their ﬁnal composition and some measure of ‘‘mixing’’ in the explosion. A grid of ﬁnal compositions is explored, including essentially all combinations of 56Ni, stable ‘‘iron,’’ and intermediate-mass elements that result in an unbound white dwarf. Light curves (and in some cases spectra) are calculated for each model using two different approaches to the radiation transport problem. Within the resulting templates are models that provide good photometric matches to essentially the entire range of observed SNe Ia. On the whole, the grid of models spans a wide range in B-band peak magnitudes and decline rates, and does not obey a Phillips relation. In particular, models with the same mass of 56Ni show large variations in their light-curve decline rates. We identify and quantify the additional physical parameters responsible for this dispersion and consider physically motivated ‘‘cuts’’ of the models that agree better with the Phillips relation, discussing why nature may have preferred these solutions. For example, models that produce a constant total mass of burned material of 1:1 Æ 0:1 M  do give a crude Phillips relation, albeit with much scatter. If one further severely mixes the ejecta strongly between the center and 0.8 M  (as might be the case in a delayed-detonation scenario) reasonable agreement with the Phillips relation results, although still with considerable spread. We conclude that the supernova models that occur most frequently in nature are highly constrained by the Phillips relation and that a large part of the currently observed scatter in the relation is likely a consequence of the intrinsic diversity of these objects.},

	abstract = {With the advent of large, deep surveys, the observation of a strongly gravitationally lensed supernova becomes increasingly likely. High-redshift surveys continue apace, with a handful of Type Ia supernovae observed to date at redshifts of 1 or greater. In addition, a satellite has been proposed (the Supernova/Acceleration Probe [SNAP]) that will be dedicated to observing thousands of supernovae per year out to a redshift of 1.7. Although it is exceedingly unlikely that we will see a multiply imaged supernova from ongoing surveys, we ﬁnd that SNAP would observe at least eight such events per year. Since having a standard candle is inessential to most lensing studies, SNAP’s large sample of Type II supernovae contributes to this rate. Each case of strong lensing allows for a precise determination of time delays, image separations, and relative image magniﬁcations, and the SNAP strong-lensing database will offer measures of Qm, QL, and H0, independent of SNAP’s primary goal of establishing the distance-redshift relation. These systems also constrain models for the matter density proﬁles of galaxies and clusters. Furthermore, lensed Type Ia supernovae afford us the opportunity to break the mass-sheet degeneracy found in many lensing measurements.},

Our results are based on almost daily observations for seven months at the ESO MPIA 2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory, reaching a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1000 per quasar image. In addition, we re-analyze existing light curves from the literature that we complete with an additional three seasons of monitoring with the Mercator telescope at La Palma Observatory. When exploring the possible source of bias we considered the so-called microlensing time delay, a potential source of systematic error so far never directly accounted for in previous time-delay publications. In 15 yr of data on PG 1115+080, we ﬁnd no strong evidence of microlensing time delay. Therefore not accounting for this eﬀect, our time-delay estimates on the individual data sets are in good agreement with each other and with the literature. Combining the data sets, we obtain the most precise time-delay estimates to date on PG 1115+080, with ∆t(AB) = 8.3−+11..56 days (18.7\% precision), ∆t(AC) = 9.9+−11..11 days (11.1\%) and ∆t(BC) = 18.8+−11..66 days (8.5\%). Turning these time delays into cosmological constraints is done in a companion paper that makes use of ground-based Adaptive Optics (AO) with the Keck telescope.},

	abstract = {We present a blind time-delay strong lensing (TDSL) cosmographic analysis of the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 . We combine the relative time delay between the quasar images, Hubble Space Telescope imaging, the Keck stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, and wide-ﬁeld photometric and spectroscopic data of the ﬁeld to constrain two angular diameter distance relations. The combined analysis is performed by forward modelling the individual data sets through a Bayesian hierarchical framework, and it is kept blind until the very end to prevent experimenter bias. After unblinding, the inferred distances imply a Hubble constant H0 = 68.8+−55..41 km s−1 Mpc−1, assuming a ﬂat cold dark matter cosmology with uniform prior on m in [0.05, 0.5]. The precision of our cosmographic measurement with the doubly imaged quasar SDSS 1206+4332 is comparable with those of quadruply imaged quasars and opens the path to perform on selected doubles the same analysis as anticipated for quads. Our analysis is based on a completely independent lensing code than our previous three H0LiCOW systems and the new measurement is fully consistent with those. We provide the analysis scripts paired with the publicly available software to facilitate independent analysis (footnote with link to www.h0licow.org). The consistency between blind measurements with independent codes provides an important sanity check on lens modelling systematics. By combining the likelihoods of the four systems under the same prior, we obtain H0 = 72.5+−22..13 km s−1 Mpc−1. This measurement is independent of the distance ladder and other cosmological probes.},

	abstract = {Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the “time-delay distance” to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 ± 15 km s−1 for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens’ environment. Our analysis of the HST images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution proﬁle logarithmic slope γ and the external convergence κext; we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density proﬁle logarithmic slope to be γ = 2.08 ± 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 ﬁeld provides an estimate of the prior for κext: 0.10−+00..0085. This latter distribution dominates the ﬁnal uncertainty on H0. Fixing the cosmological parameters at Ωm = 0.3, ΩΛ = 0.7, and w = −1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we ﬁnd H0 = 70.6−+33..11 km s−1 Mpc−1. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over κext. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) ﬁve-year data set, we ﬁnd that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between Ωm and ΩΛ at w = −1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be −0.031 {\textless} Ωk {\textless} 0.009 (95\% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a ﬂat spatial geometry, we ﬁnd that, in combination with WMAP, H0 = 69.7−+45..90 km s−1 Mpc−1 and w = −0.94−+00..1179 (68\% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do.},

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples.

The PS1 and SDSS-II calibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ∼0.02 mag are recovered.

The software is designed with the primary goal of using SNe Ia as distance indicators for the determination of cosmological parameters, but it can also be used to study efficiencies for analyses of SN rates, estimate contamination from non-Ia SNe, and optimize future surveys. Several SN models are available within the same software architecture, allowing technical features such as K-corrections to be consistently used among multiple models, and thus making it easier to make detailed comparisons between models. New and improved light-curve models can be easily added. The software works with arbitrary surveys and telescopes and has already been used by several collaborations, leading to more robust and easy-to-use code. This software is not intended as a final product release, but rather it is designed to undergo continual improvements from the community as more is learned about SNe. We give an overview of the SNANA capabilities, as well as some of its limitations.},

The peak magnitude is corrected for extinction using an estimate determined from MLCS2k2 ﬁtting. The rise time is measured from the well-observed B-band light curve with the ﬁrst detection at least 1mag fainter than the peak magnitude, and the photospheric velocity is measured from the strong absorption feature of Si IIλ6355 at the time of peak brightness. We model the relationship among these three parameters using an expanding ﬁreball with two assumptions: (a) the optical emission is approximately that of a blackbody, and (b) the photospheric temperatures of all SNeIa are the same at the time of peak brightness. We compare the precision of the distance residuals inferred using this physically motivated model against those from the empirical Phillips relation and the MLCS2k2 method for 47 low-redshift SNeIa (0.005 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.04) and ﬁnd comparable scatter. However, SNeIa in our sample with higher velocities are inferred to be intrinsically fainter. Eliminating the high-velocity SNe and applying a more stringent extinction cut to obtain a “low-v golden sample” of 22 SNe, we obtain signiﬁcantly reduced scatter of 0.108±0.018mag in the new relation, better than those of the Phillips relation and the MLCS2k2 method. For 250 km s−1 of residual peculiar motions, we ﬁnd 68\% and 95\% upper limits on the intrinsic scatter of 0.07 and 0.10 mag, respectively.},

Line ﬂuorescence processes can also be treated directly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer calculation, providing a direct link between multidimensional hydrodynamic explosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques applied in SEDONA and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations. We ﬁnd that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for complicated multidimensional conﬁgurations.

We ﬁnd that lensed images in regions of low convergence, shear and stellar density are standardizable, where the microlensing scatter is 0.15 mag, comparable to the intrinsic dispersion of a typical SN Ia. These standardizable conﬁgurations correspond to asymmetric lenses with an image located far outside the Einstein radius of the lens. Symmetric and small Einstein radius lenses ( 0.5 arcsec) are not standardizable. We apply our model to the recently discovered GLSN Ia iPTF16geu and ﬁnd that the large discrepancy between the observed ﬂux and the macromodel predictions from More et al. cannot be explained by microlensing alone. Using the mock GLSNe Ia catalogue of Goldstein et al., we predict that ∼22 per cent of GLSNe Ia discovered by Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be standardizable, with a median Einstein radius of 0.9 arcsec and a median time delay of 41 d. By breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy the full LSST GLSNe Ia sample will be able to detect systematics in H0 at the 0.5 per cent level.},

Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the glSNIa yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the effect of microlensing on the precision and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from LSST glSNeIa. Microlensing has a negligible effect on the LSST glSNIa yield, but it can be increased by a factor of ∼2 over previous predictions to 930 systems using a novel photometric identiﬁcation technique based on spectral template ﬁtting. Crucially, the microlensing of glSNeIa is achromatic until three restframe weeks after the explosion, making the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay indicators. By ﬁtting simulated ﬂux and color observations of microlensed glSNeIa with their underlying, unlensed spectral templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for LSST, which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color curve observations in the achromatic phase, while for light-curve observations it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties (4\%). About 70\% of LSST glSNIa images should be discovered during the achromatic phase, indicating that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for microlensing, the 1–2 day time delay on the recently discovered glSNIa iPTF16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.},

These new discoveries will enable a move from single-quasar studies to investigations of statistical samples, presenting new opportunities to test theoretical models for the structure of quasar accretion disks and broad emission line regions (BELRs). As one crucial step in preparing for this inﬂux of new lensed systems, a large-scale exploration of microlensing convergence–shear parameter space is warranted, requiring the computation of O(105) high-resolution magniﬁcation maps. Based on properties of known lensed quasars, and expectations from accretion disk/BELR modeling, we identify regions of convergence–shear parameter space, map sizes, smooth matter fractions, and pixel resolutions that should be covered. We describe how the computationally time-consuming task of producing ∼290,000 magniﬁcation maps with sufﬁcient resolution (10,0002 pixel map−1) to probe scales from the inner edge of the accretion disk to the BELR can be achieved in ∼400 days on a 100 teraﬂop s−1 high-performance computing facility, where the processing performance is achieved with graphics processing units. We illustrate a use-case for the parameter survey by investigating the effects of varying the lens macro-model on accretion disk constraints in the lensed quasar Q2237+0305. We ﬁnd that although all constraints are consistent within their current error bars, models with more densely packed microlenses tend to predict shallower accretion disk radial temperature proﬁles. With a large parameter survey such as the one described here, such systematics on microlensing measurements could be fully explored.},

	abstract = {The time-delay between the arrival of photons of multiple images of time-variable sources can be used to constrain absolute distances in the Universe, and in turn obtain a direct estimate of the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters. To convert the time-delay into distances, it is well known that the gravitational potential of the main deﬂector and the contribution of the matter along the line of sight need to be known to a sufﬁcient level of precision. In this paper, we discuss a new astrometric requirement that is becoming important, as time-delay cosmography improves in precision and accuracy with larger samples, and better data and modelling techniques. We derive an analytic expression for the propagation of astrometric uncertainties on the multiple image positions into the inference of the Hubble constant and derive requirements depending on image separation and relative time-delay. We note that this requirement applies equally to the image position measurements and to the accuracy of the model in reproducing them. To illustrate the requirement, we discuss some example lensing conﬁgurations and highlight that, especially for time-delays of order 10 d or shorter, the relative astrometric requirement is of order milliarcseconds, setting a tight requirement on both measurements and models. With current optical infrared technology, astrometric uncertainties may be the dominant limitation for strong lensing cosmography in the small image-separation regime when high-precision time-delays become accessible.},

We present an observational study to investigate if such a relationship exists. Using the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT) we have obtained intermediate-resolution spectroscopy data of a sample of 28 local galaxies hosting SNeIa, for which distances have been derived using methods independent of those based on SNIa parameters. From the emission lines observed in their optical spectra, we derived the gas-phase oxygen abundance in the region where each SN Ia exploded. Our data show a trend, with an 80\% of chance not being due to random ﬂuctuation, between SNeIa absolute magnitudes and the oxygen abundances of the host galaxies, in the sense that luminosities tend to be higher for galaxies with lower metallicities. This result seems likely to be in agreement with both the theoretically expected behavior and with other observational results. This dependence MB–Z might induce systematic errors when it is not considered when deriving SNeIa luminosities and then using them to derive cosmological distances.},

The sample selection only considered galaxies for which distances not based on the SN Ia method are available. Then, we use a principal component analysis to study the dependence of the absolute magnitudes on the colour of the SN Ia, the oxygen abundances of the region where they exploded and the stretch of the SN light curve. We demonstrate that our previous result suggesting a metallicity dependence on the SN Ia luminosity for non-reddened SNe Ia can be extended to our whole sample. These results reinforce the need of including a metallicity proxy, such as the oxygen abundance of the host galaxy, to minimize the systematic effect induced by the metallicity dependence of the SN Ia luminosity in future studies of SNe Ia at cosmological distances.},

	abstract = {Methods. The Nearby Supernova Factory has obtained ﬂux-calibrated spectral timeseries for SNe Ia using integral ﬁeld spectroscopy. These observations enabled the simultaneous measurement of the SN and its immediate vicinity. For 89 SNe Ia we measured or set limits on Hα emission, used as a tracer of ongoing star formation, within a 1 kpc radius around each SN. This constitutes the ﬁrst direct study of the local environment for a large sample of SNe Ia with accurate luminosity, color, and stretch measurements.
Results. Our local star formation measurements provide several critical new insights. We ﬁnd that SNe Ia with local Hα emission are redder by 0.036 ± 0.017 mag, and that the previously noted correlation between stretch and host mass is driven entirely by the SNe Ia coming from locally passive environments, in particular at the low-stretch end. There is no such trend for SNe Ia in locally star-forming environments. Our most important ﬁnding is that the mean standardized brightness for SNe Ia with local Hα emission is 0.094 ± 0.031 mag fainter on average than for those without. This oﬀset arises from a bimodal structure in the Hubble residuals, with one mode being shared by SNe Ia in all environments and the other one exclusive to SNe Ia in locally passive environments. This structure also explains the previously known host-mass bias. We combine the star formation dependence of this bimodality with the cosmic star formation rate to predict changes with redshift in the mean SN Ia brightness and the host-mass bias. The strong change predicted is conﬁrmed using high-redshift SNe Ia from the literature.
Conclusions. The environmental dependences in SN Ia Hubble residuals and color found here point to remaining systematic errors in the standardization of SNe Ia. In particular, the observed brightness oﬀset associated with local Hα emission is predicted to cause a signiﬁcant bias in current measurements of the dark energy equation of state. Recognition of these eﬀects oﬀers new opportunities to improve SNe Ia as cosmological probes. For instance, we note that the SNe Ia associated with local Hα emission are more homogeneous, resulting in a brightness dispersion of only 0.105 ± 0.012 mag.},

With these data we ﬁnd new evidence for a correlation between SN Ia intrinsic color and host metallicity. When we combine our data with those of other published SN Ia surveys, we ﬁnd the difference between mean SN Ia brightnesses in low- and high-mass hosts is 0.077 ± 0.014 mag. When viewed in narrow (0.2 dex) bins of host stellar mass, the data reveal apparent plateaus of Hubble residuals at high and low host masses with a rapid transition over a short mass range (9.8 log(M∗/M ) 10.4). Although metallicity has been a favored interpretation for the origin of the Hubble residual trend with host mass, we illustrate how dust in star-forming galaxies and mean SN Ia progenitor age both evolve along the galaxy mass sequence, thereby presenting equally viable explanations for some or all of the observed SN Ia host bias.},

We re-discover, to high signiﬁcance, the strong correlation between host galaxy type and the width of the observed SN light curve, i.e., fainter, quickly declining SNe Ia favor passive host galaxies, while brighter, slowly declining Ia’s favor star-forming galaxies. We also ﬁnd evidence (at between 2σ and 3σ ) that SNe Ia are 0.1 ± 0.04 mag brighter in passive host galaxies than in star-forming hosts, after the SN Ia light curves have been standardized using the light-curve shape and color variations. This difference in brightness is present in both the SALT2 and MCLS2k2 light-curve ﬁtting methodologies. We see evidence for differences in the SN Ia color relationship between passive and star-forming host galaxies, e.g., for the MLCS2k2 technique, we see that SNe Ia in passive hosts favor a dust law of RV = 1.0 ± 0.2, while SNe Ia in star-forming hosts require RV = 1.8−+00..24. The signiﬁcance of these trends depends on the range of SN colors considered. We demonstrate that these effects can be parameterized using the stellar mass of the host galaxy (with a conﬁdence of {\textgreater}4σ ) and including this extra parameter provides a better statistical ﬁt to our data. Our results suggest that future cosmological analyses of SN Ia samples should include host galaxy information.},

Models in which the SN Ia rate depends solely on host galaxy stellar mass are ruled out with {\textgreater}99\% conﬁdence. Our analysis is based on 100 spectroscopically conﬁrmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically classiﬁed events, all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and distributed over 0:2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0:75. We estimate stellar masses and SFRs for the SN Ia host galaxies by ﬁtting their broadband spectral energy distributions with the galaxy spectral synthesis code PE´ GASE.2. We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the speciﬁc SFR of the parent galaxies—more vigorously star-forming galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later type galaxies seen in the local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple ‘‘two-component’’ model approximating the SN Ia rate, we ﬁnd bivariate linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the mean SFRs of the host systems. We ﬁnd that the SN Ia rate can be well represented as the sum of 5:3 Æ 1:1 ; 10À14 SNe yrÀ1 M À1 and 3:9 Æ 0:7 ; 10À4 SNe yrÀ1 (M  yrÀ1)À1 of star formation. We also demonstrate a dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star formation in the host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally. Passive galaxies, with no star formation, preferentially host faster declining/dimmer SNe Ia, while brighter events are found in systems with ongoing star formation.},

We present a set of spectral time-series templates designed for this purpose, for both hydrogen-rich (type II, IIn, IIb) and stripped envelope (types Ib, Ic, Ic-BL) core collapse supernovae. We use photometric and spectroscopic data for 67 core collapse supernovae from the literature, and for each generate a time-series spectral template. The techniques used to build the templates are fully data-driven with no assumption of any parametric form or model for the light curves. The template-building code is open-source, and can be applied to any transient for which well-sampled multi-band photometry and multiple spectroscopic observations are available. We extend these spectral templates into the near-ultraviolet to \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}sim 1600 {\textbackslash}AA\$ using observer-frame ultraviolet photometry. We also provide a set of templates corrected for host galaxy dust extinction, and provide a set of luminosity functions that can be used with our spectral templates in simulations. We give an example of how these templates can be used by integrating them within the popular SN simulation package \${\textbackslash}textsc\{snana\}\$, and simulating core collapse supernovae in photometrically-selected cosmological type Ia supernova samples, prone to contamination from core collapse events.},

Since we draw from many sources, we signiﬁcantly improve the spectra by inspecting these data for quality, removing galactic emission lines and cosmic rays, generating variance spectra, and correcting for the reddening caused by both MW and host-galaxy dust. With our data base, we organize this homogenized data set by 56 unique categories of SN-speciﬁc and spectrum-speciﬁc metadata. With KAEPORA, we produce composite spectra of subpopulations of SNe Ia and examine how spectral features correlate with various SN properties. These composite spectra reproduce known correlations with phase, light-curve shape, and host-galaxy morphology. With our large data set, we are also able to generate ﬁne-grained composite spectra simultaneously over both phase and light-curve shape. The colour evolution of our composite spectra is consistent with other SN Ia template spectra, and the spectral properties of our composite spectra are in rough agreement with these template spectra with some subtle differences. We investigate the spectral differences of SNe Ia that occur in galaxies with varying morphologies. Controlling for light-curve shape, which is highly correlated with host-galaxy morphology, we ﬁnd that SNe Ia residing in late-type and early-type galaxies have similar spectral properties at multiple epochs. However for SNe Ia in these different environments, their spectra appear to have Ca II near-infrared triplet features that have slightly different strengths. Although this is apparent in the composite spectra and there is some difference in the populations as seen by individual spectra, this difference is not large enough to indicate differences in the underlying populations. All individual spectra and metadata are available in our open-source data base KAEPORA along with the tools developed for this investigation to facilitate future investigations of SN Ia properties.},

	abstract = {Recently, there have been two landmark discoveries of gravitationally lensed supernovae: the ﬁrst multiply imaged SN, “Refsdal”, and the ﬁrst Type Ia SN resolved into multiple images, SN iPTF16geu. Fitting the multiple light curves of such objects can deliver measurements of the lensing time delays, which are the difference in arrival times for the separate images. These measurements provide precise tests of lens models or constraints on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters that are independent of the local distance ladder. Over the next decade, accurate time delay measurements will be needed for the tens to hundreds of lensed SNe to be found by wide-ﬁeld time-domain surveys such as LSST and WFIRST. We have developed an open-source software package for simulations and time delay measurements of multiply imaged SNe, including an improved characterization of the uncertainty caused by microlensing. Using this package, we describe simulations that suggest that a beforepeak detection of the leading image enables a more accurate and precise time delay measurement (by ∼1 and ∼2 days, respectively), when compared to an after-peak detection. We also conclude that ﬁtting the effects of microlensing without an accurate prior often leads to biases in the time delay measurement and over-ﬁtting to the data, but that employing a Gaussian Process Regression technique is sufﬁcient for determining the uncertainty due to microlensing.},

	abstract = {Calibration uncertainties have been the leading systematic uncertainty in recent analyses using Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to measure cosmological parameters. To improve the calibration, we present the application of spectral energy distribution-dependent ‘chromatic corrections’ to the SN light-curve photometry from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). These corrections depend on the combined atmospheric and instrumental transmission function for each exposure, and they affect photometry at the 0.01 mag (1 per cent) level, comparable to systematic uncertainties in calibration and photometry. Fitting our combined DES and lowz SN Ia sample with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors for the cosmological parameters m (the fraction of the critical density of the universe comprised of matter) and w (the dark energy equation of state parameter), we compare those parameters before and after applying the corrections. We ﬁnd the change in w and m due to not including chromatic corrections is −0.002 and 0.000, respectively, for the DES-SN3YR sample with BAO and CMB priors, consistent with a larger DES-SN3YR-like simulation, which has a w-change of 0.0005 with an uncertainty of 0.008 and an m change of 0.000 with an uncertainty of 0.002. However, when considering samples on individual CCDs we ﬁnd large redshift-dependent biases (∼0.02 in distance modulus) for SN distances.},

	abstract = {With the advent of large dedicated Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) surveys, K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially important in the determination of cosmological parameters. While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broadband colors, it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame ﬁlters are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame ﬁlters are misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series that incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broadband colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features. Finally, we present a template spectroscopic sequence near maximum light for further improvement on the K-correction estimate. A library of \$600 observed spectra of \$100 SNe Ia from heterogeneous sources is used for the analysis.},

	abstract = {Cadenced optical imaging surveys in the next decade will be capable of detecting timevarying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in large numbers, increasing the size of the statistically well-deﬁned samples of multiply imaged quasars by two orders of magnitude, and discovering the ﬁrst strongly lensed supernovae. We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magniﬁcation bias and image conﬁguration detectability into account. We ﬁnd that upcoming wide-ﬁeld synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should ﬁnd more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The LSST should also ﬁnd some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with ∼15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be ∼15 per cent for the lensed quasars and ∼30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed doubleimage lenses, as could be derived from the LSST survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent conﬁdence intervals are σ (w0) = 0.15, σ (wa) = 0.41 and σ (h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy ﬁgure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.},

The model is trained with a sample of well-measured nearby SN Ia and then tested with an independent set of supernovae by building an optimal luminosity distance estimator that combines the supernova rest-frame luminosity, shape parameter, and color reconstructed with the model. The distances we measure using B- and V-band data show a dispersion around the Hubble line comparable or lower than obtained with other methods. With this model, we are able to measure distances using U- and B-band data with a dispersion of 0.16 ± 0.05 around the Hubble line.},

New and improved light-curve models can be easily added.

We ﬁnd that the maximum-light velocity of Si ii λ6355 and Ca ii H\&K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si ii λ6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si ii λ6355 measurements. Ca ii H\&K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer. Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference. The intrinsic color scatter is larger for higher-velocity SNe Ia—even after removing a linear trend with velocity—indicating that lower-velocity SNe Ia are more “standard crayons.” Employing information derived from SN Ia spectra has the potential to improve the measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological properties inferred from them.},

	abstract = {We study the stellar populations of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-II spectroscopy. The main focus is on the relationships of SN Ia properties with stellar velocity dispersion and the stellar population parameters age, metallicity and element abundance ratios. We concentrate on a sub-sample of 84 SNe Ia from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey and ﬁnd that SALT2 stretch factor values show the strongest dependence on stellar population age. Hence, more luminous SNe Ia appear in younger stellar progenitor systems. No statistically signiﬁcant trends in the Hubble residual with any of the stellar population parameters studied are found. Moreover, the method of photometric stellar mass derivation affects the Hubble residual–mass relationship. For an extended sample (247 objects), including SNe Ia with SDSS host galaxy photometry only, the Hubble residual–mass relationship behaves as a sloped step function. In the high-mass regime, probed by our host spectroscopy sample, this relationship is ﬂat. Below a stellar mass of ∼2 × 1010 M , i.e. close to the evolutionary transition mass of low-redshift galaxies, the trend changes dramatically such that lower mass galaxies possess lower luminosity SNe Ia after light-curve corrections. The sloped step function of the Hubble residual–mass relationship should be accounted for when using stellar mass as a further parameter for minimizing the Hubble residuals.},

	abstract = {The Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) was the highest-ranked large space-based mission of the 2010 New Worlds, New Horizons decadal survey. It is now a NASA mission in formulation with a planned launch in the mid 2020s. A primary mission objective is to precisely constrain the nature of dark energy through multiple probes, including Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia). Here, we present the ﬁrst realistic simulations of the WFIRST SN survey based on current hardware speciﬁcations and using open-source tools. We simulate SN light curves and spectra as viewed by the WFIRST wide-ﬁeld channel (WFC) imager and integral ﬁeld channel (IFC) spectrometer, respectively. We examine 11 survey strategies with different time allocations between the WFC and IFC, two of which are based upon the strategy described by the WFIRST Science Deﬁnition Team, which measures SN distances exclusively from IFC data. We propagate statistical and, crucially, systematic uncertainties to predict the Dark Energy Task Force ﬁgure of merit (FoM) for each strategy. Of the strategies investigated, we ﬁnd the most successful to be WFC focused. However, further work in constraining systematics is required to fully optimize the use of the IFC. Even without improvements to other cosmological probes, the WFIRST SN survey has the potential to increase the FoM by more than an order of magnitude from the current values. Although the survey strategies presented here have not been fully optimized, these initial investigations are an important step in the development of the ﬁnal hardware design and implementation of the WFIRST mission.},

	abstract = {The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a high étendue imaging facility that is being constructed atop Cerro Pachón in northern Chile. It is scheduled to begin science operations in 2022. With an ( effective) aperture, a novel three-mirror design achieving a seeing-limited field of view, and a 3.2 gigapixel camera, the LSST has the deep-wide-fast imaging capability necessary to carry out an survey in six passbands (ugrizy) to a coadded depth of over 10 years using of its observational time. The remaining of the time will be devoted to considerably deeper and faster time-domain observations and smaller surveys. In total, each patch of the sky in the main survey will receive 800 visits allocated across the six passbands with exposure visits. The huge volume of high-quality LSST data will provide a wide range of science opportunities and, in particular, open a new era of precision cosmology with unprecedented statistical power and tight control of systematic errors. In this review, we give a brief account of the LSST cosmology program with an emphasis on dark energy investigations. The LSST will address dark energy physics and cosmology in general by exploiting diverse precision probes including large-scale structure, weak lensing, type Ia supernovae, galaxy clusters, and strong lensing. Combined with the cosmic microwave background data, these probes form interlocking tests on the cosmological model and the nature of dark energy in the presence of various systematics. The LSST data products will be made available to the US and Chilean scientific communities and to international partners with no proprietary period. Close collaborations with contemporaneous imaging and spectroscopy surveys observing at a variety of wavelengths, resolutions, depths, and timescales will be a vital part of the LSST science program, which will not only enhance specific studies but, more importantly, also allow a more complete understanding of the Universe through different windows.},

This validation includes residuals from the light curve training process, systematic biases in SN Ia distance measurements, and a bias on the dark energy equation of state parameter w. Using the SN-analysis package SNANA, we simulate and analyze realistic samples corresponding to the data samples used in the SNLS3 analysis: ∼120 low-redshift (z {\textless} 0.1) SNe Ia, ∼255 Sloan Digital Sky Survey SNe Ia (z {\textless} 0.4), and ∼290 SNLS SNe Ia (z 1). To probe systematic uncertainties in detail, we vary the input spectral model, the model of intrinsic scatter, and the smoothing (i.e., regularization) parameters used during the SALT-II model training. Using realistic intrinsic scatter models results in a slight bias in the ultraviolet portion of the trained SALT-II model, and w biases (winput − wrecovered) ranging from −0.005 ± 0.012 to −0.024 ± 0.010. These biases are indistinguishable from each other within the uncertainty; the average bias on w is −0.014 ± 0.007.},

	abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (\$H\_\{0\}\$) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}\$, a 2.4\% precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of \$H\_\{0\}\$ from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in \$3.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in \$5.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ CMB determinations of \$H\_\{0\}\$ in flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from \$Planck\$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our \$H\_\{0\}\$ inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on \$H\_0\$ ranges from 73-78 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}{\textasciitilde}Mpc{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},
